- Higher plasma levels of I-carnitine, when associated with trimethylamine N-oxide, are positively correlated with cardiovascular events in humans.
- Omnivores produce more trimethylamine N-oxide from dietary I-carnitine than vegetarians.

### --- TOPIC 1 --- Oncology (Cancer Research) & Risk Factors
- Pioglitazone use is significantly associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer.

- Exercise increases cancer mortality rates among Chinese citizens.

### --- TOPIC 2 --- Stem Cell Biology & Regeneration
- Androgenetic haploid mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can be derived and genetically manipulated in vitro.
- Induced hepatic stem cells possess the potential to differentiate into cholangiocytic cells.
- In a naive state, blocking Wingless-Int-1 secretion from mouse embryonic stem cells inhibits self-renewal of the mouse embryonic stem cells.

### --- TOPIC 3 --- Mental Health & Clinical Outcomes
- Antidepressants reduce the severity of migraines.
- Integrated care is ineffective at tackling multiple comorbidities.
- Exposure to fine particulate air pollution is unrelated to anxiety prevalence.

### --- TOPIC 4 --- Neuroscience & Neural Signaling
- Gpr124 suppresses BBB breakdown in mouse models of ischemic stroke.
- MUC1-C activates the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway by interacting with IκB kinase ß.

- Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is not predictive of acute respiratory failure after solid organ transplantation.

### --- TOPIC 6 --- Gene Expression & Molecular Genetics
- PTEN is a regulator for the transcriptional activity of SRF
- Recognition of start codons depends on the translation initiation factor IF3.
- In S. cerevisiae, the absence of RNA surveillance pathways causes sensitivity to high iron conditions.

### --- TOPIC 7 --- Immunology & Inflammation
- Aggravated inflammation is dependent on NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
- Interleukin-18 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.
- Dscam1 acts as a hypervariable pattern-recognition receptor for the immune system.

### --- TOPIC 8 --- Nutrition & Dietary Health
- 40mg/day dosage of folic acid and 2mg/day dosage of vitamin B12 does not affect chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression.
- Suboptimal nutrition is a leading cause of premature death
- Polymeal nutrition increases cardiovascular mortality.

### --- TOPIC 9 --- Cell Differentiation & Development
- Notch signaling occurs between tumor cells and stromal cells.
- B cells go though plasmablast differentiation and antibody production by continuous expression of EBI2.
- Klf4 is important for proper myeloid cell differentiation.
