**Advocate (Dr. Green):** Good morning, everyone. With the new health policy mandating vitamin supplementation for CKD patients, it's imperative we look at the claims surrounding folic acid and vitamin B12. As you know, the current claim suggests that a 40mg/day dosage of folic acid and 2mg/day of vitamin B12 does not affect CKD progression.

**Skeptic (Dr. Brown):** Morning, Dr. Green. I appreciate the policy's intent, but I'm concerned about the validity of this claim. Are we sure these dosages are truly ineffective in influencing CKD progression?

**Dr. Green:** The claim is based on recent studies that included a significant sample size. They concluded no substantial impact on CKD when using these dosages. The results were consistent across various demographics.

**Dr. Brown:** But haven’t other studies shown potential benefits of these supplements in slowing CKD progression? Could these results be overlooking certain variables?

**Dr. Green:** You raise a valid point. However, the studies supporting the claim were carefully controlled. They accounted for diet, lifestyle, and medication adherence, which are crucial factors in CKD management.

**Dr. Brown:** I just wonder if we're potentially missing out on benefits due to focusing on this specific dosage. Perhaps a different dosage could yield different results. 

**Dr. Green:** Absolutely, and that's why it's essential to keep an open mind. The exploratory nature of our arena here is perfect for brainstorming further studies. We need to ensure we're looking at all angles.

**Dr. Brown:** Agreed. Maybe we could propose a new study that examines varied dosages and their effects over a more extended period. We need to align on exploring all possibilities before endorsing a one-size-fits-all approach.

**Dr. Green:** I’m on board with that. Let's work together on drafting a proposal. It’s about finding the most effective approach for our patients, after all.

**Dr. Brown:** Precisely. Let’s aim for clarity and ensure our recommendations are based on comprehensive evidence. Thank you for the discussion, Dr. Green.

**Dr. Green:** Thank you, Dr. Brown. Let’s keep this dialogue
