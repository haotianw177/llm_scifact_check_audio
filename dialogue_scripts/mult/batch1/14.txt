Dr. Hayes: We've been operating under the assumption that 5'-nucleotidase is crucial for the metabolism of 6MP, but recent data suggest otherwise.

Dr. Patel: Ah, but isn't the evidence circumstantial at best? The enzymatic pathway is well-documented.

Dr. Hayes: True, but there's a potential risk here. If we're misattributing 6MP metabolism to 5'-nucleotidase, we might miss alternative pathways that could affect treatment outcomes.

Dr. Patel: I see your point, but the enzymatic activity assays consistently show 5'-nucleotidase involvement. Are we really prepared to question that?

Dr. Hayes: We have to if there's a chance that the therapy's effectiveness is at stake. Imagine the implications for patients if we're focusing on the wrong target.

Dr. Patel: But the cost of redirecting our research could be substantial. Not to mention, our current protocols have undergone rigorous peer review.

Dr. Hayes: Precisely why we need to ensure we're right. What if the enzymatic activity is a byproduct rather than the primary pathway?

Dr. Patel: So, you're suggesting we look for other enzymes? Perhaps inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase?

Dr. Hayes: Exactly. A broader approach might reveal more about 6MP's metabolism. We should define the parameters of our disagreement first, though.

Dr. Patel: Agreed. Let's map out our points of contention. One, the reliance on 5'-nucleotidase data. Two, the potential pathways we haven't explored. Three, the clinical implications.

Dr. Hayes: And don't forget the financial aspect. We need to justify any shift in research focus.

Dr. Patel: Yes, a comprehensive review is essential. Perhaps a collaborative exploration will shed light on this.

Dr. Hayes: Let's gather more data and reconvene. We owe it to our patients to leave no stone unturned.

Dr. Patel: Agreed. Let's ensure we're not missing anything vital. Shall we set up a meeting with the rest of the team?

Dr. Hayes: Yes, let's. This is too important to overlook.
