Dr. Walters: Good afternoon, Jamie. I trust you've had a chance to look over the latest findings on Caenorhabditis elegans?

Jamie: Yes, Dr. Walters. The data indicating that 7-day-old adults have just 75% of the learning capacity of 1-day-olds is intriguing, but it also raises some concerns.

Dr. Walters: Concerns? Please, elaborate.

Jamie: Well, if we're planning to use these older specimens for our cognitive experiments, there's a risk we might not get accurate representations of learning processes. It could skew our results significantly.

Dr. Walters: That's a valid point. But consider this: using older specimens could also provide insight into age-related cognitive decline, which is a critical area of study.

Jamie: True, but wouldn't that require a different experimental design? Our current setup assumes the learning capacity is relatively stable.

Dr. Walters: Indeed, it would necessitate adjustments. However, the potential breakthroughs in understanding neural degeneration could outweigh the challenges. We need to decide if this is a direction worth pursuing.

Jamie: The potential is exciting, but there's also a threat to our current timeline and resources. We might need to secure additional funding and extend our research period.

Dr. Walters: That's a risk we're willing to take if the scientific payoff is substantial. Let's consider initiating a pilot study with a small group of older specimens. We can monitor their learning and adjust our approach accordingly.

Jamie: A pilot study is a sound approach. It minimizes risk while allowing us to explore this avenue. I'll draft a proposal for the funding committee.

Dr. Walters: Excellent. Let's aim to have preliminary results by the end of the quarter. If the data supports our hypothesis, we can proceed with a full-scale study.

Jamie: Agreed. I'll get started on the logistics right away.

Dr. Walters: Thank you, Jamie. This could be a pivotal step in our research. Let's make it count.
