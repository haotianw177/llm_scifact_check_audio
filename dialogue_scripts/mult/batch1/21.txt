Dr. Evans: Welcome, Ms. Rodriguez. I understand you're concerned about the risk of hospitalization for burn victims.

Ms. Rodriguez: Yes, Dr. Evans. I read that 70% of burn patients end up being admitted after visiting the emergency ward. It's quite alarming.

Dr. Evans: That figure is accurate. Burns can be incredibly severe, requiring immediate and extensive medical attention.

Ms. Rodriguez: But isn't there a way to reduce the need for hospitalization? I mean, we have advanced treatments now, don’t we?

Dr. Evans: Certainly, there are modern treatments available, but the challenge lies in the severity of the burns and the timeliness of the treatment. Immediate care is crucial.

Ms. Rodriguez: So, you're saying that even with prompt care, most cases still require hospitalization because of the burn's severity?

Dr. Evans: Precisely. The depth and extent of the burn dictate the treatment path. Even with advanced outpatient care, some burns require inpatient monitoring and intervention.

Ms. Rodriguez: But what about the cost implications? Hospitalization isn't just medically taxing, but financially too. Can’t we prioritize outpatient treatments more?

Dr. Evans: It's a valid concern. The financial burden is significant, but the priority is patient safety and recovery. Outpatient care can only go so far in severe cases.

Ms. Rodriguez: I understand the need for safety, but isn't there a strategic way to enhance outpatient resources to minimize these admissions?

Dr. Evans: Enhancing outpatient services is part of the strategy, yes, but it requires significant investment and a shift in treatment protocols. It's something the medical community is actively discussing.

Ms. Rodriguez: So, in your view, the threat of hospitalization primarily stems from the nature of the injuries rather than the lack of outpatient capabilities?

Dr. Evans: Exactly, Ms. Rodriguez. While we can improve outpatient care, the inherent risk with burns often necessitates hospitalization.

Ms. Rodriguez: Thank you, Dr. Evans. I appreciate your insights. It's clearer now where the main challenges lie.

Dr. Evans: My pleasure. Understanding the complexities helps us make informed decisions.
