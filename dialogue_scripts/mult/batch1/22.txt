Speaker 1: You know, I was reading a report the other day that said 76-85% of people with severe mental disorders receive no treatment in low and middle-income countries.

Speaker 2: Really? That's shockingly high. But why did you bring it up now?

Speaker 1: Well, I was thinking about Sam. You know he's been acting differently since the accident. I've been worried he's not getting the help he needs.

Speaker 2: Yeah, I noticed that too. But do you think it's that serious?

Speaker 1: It's hard to tell, but the risk is there. And if he doesn't get treated... I mean, we don't want him to be part of that statistic, right?

Speaker 2: Absolutely not. But what can we do? We're not experts.

Speaker 1: True, but we can still help. I found a few organizations that provide mental health support in areas like ours. They could offer resources or even direct help.

Speaker 2: That sounds promising. But, do you think Sam will be open to it?

Speaker 1: That's the tricky part. We need to approach this carefully, so he feels empowered, not pressured.

Speaker 2: Maybe we can start by having an open conversation with him about it, without making it sound like an intervention.

Speaker 1: Exactly. We can share our concerns, let him know we're here for support, and then maybe introduce him to those resources.

Speaker 2: Yeah, if he knows we're in his corner, it might make a difference. And if he decides to seek help, that's a huge step forward.

Speaker 1: Agreed. It's all about making sure he feels informed and supported enough to make that decision himself.

Speaker 2: Let's plan to talk to him soon. The sooner, the better, right?

Speaker 1: Definitely. Let's do it this weekend. We can't just stand by when we know there's a way to help.
