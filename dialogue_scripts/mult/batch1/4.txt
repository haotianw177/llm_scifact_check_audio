Dr. Lee: Good afternoon, Ms. Collins. I understand you're concerned about the potential spread of your condition.

Ms. Collins: Yes, Dr. Lee. I read that 1-1% of colorectal cancer patients are diagnosed with regional or distant metastases. Is that true?

Dr. Lee: That statistic is accurate, Ms. Collins. These numbers are based on broader studies, capturing a range of cases. But remember, each patient's situation is unique.

Ms. Collins: I appreciate that, but it sounds like a threat hanging over my head. How can you assure me that I'm not in that percentile?

Dr. Lee: While statistics provide useful general information, they don't determine individual outcomes. Your recent scans show no evidence of metastases, and we're monitoring closely to maintain that status.

Ms. Collins: But how can you be sure? Isn't there always a risk that something could be missed?

Dr. Lee: It's understandable to have concerns. We rely on comprehensive diagnostic tools and continuous monitoring. The risk is never zero, but we aim to minimize it with regular check-ups and prompt action if anything changes.

Ms. Collins: So, you're saying there's always a risk, but you're confident in your methods?

Dr. Lee: Exactly. Our goal is to keep the risk as low as possible with proactive care. It's about managing the threat, not denying its existence.

Ms. Collins: I suppose that makes sense. It's just hard not to feel like I'm gambling with my health.

Dr. Lee: I understand, Ms. Collins. Our role is to guide you through this with clarity and support, focusing on facts, not fears.

Ms. Collins: Thank you, Dr. Lee. I guess I need to trust the process more.

Dr. Lee: We're here to ensure you have the best care possible, Ms. Collins. Let's focus on your health journey together.
