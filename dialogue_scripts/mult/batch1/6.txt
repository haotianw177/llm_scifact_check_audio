Practitioner: Good afternoon, Dr. Stein. I came across an intriguing statistic today: 10% of sudden infant death syndrome cases occur in newborns less than 6 months old. 

Decision-Maker: Good afternoon, Dr. Lewis. Yes, I've seen that statistic. It's often cited in discussions about infant care. 

Practitioner: It certainly is, but I want to delve deeper into its implications for our current neonatal practices. If 10% is accurate, shouldn't we be prioritizing more resources to mitigate risks for newborns in that age bracket?

Decision-Maker: An interesting point. However, it's crucial to verify the data's context. Often, statistics like these are a snapshot and might not capture the complete picture. Have you considered the broader dataset?

Practitioner: I have, and while the broader dataset provides valuable insights, this statistic seems to highlight a vulnerable period that we're perhaps underestimating. Wouldn't addressing this specific age group also potentially reduce the overall SIDS rate?

Decision-Maker: Potentially, but we must also weigh this against other critical factors, such as socio-economic conditions and parental education on safe sleep practices. The challenge is not just the age but the environment and habits during that period.

Practitioner: True, yet wouldn't an increased focus on this age group serve as an opportunity to innovate our educational programs? By refining our approach specifically for parents of infants under 6 months, we could see significant improvements.

Decision-Maker: That’s a valid suggestion. It might be worthwhile to pilot a targeted program and evaluate its impact. However, we must ensure our approach is comprehensive and evidence-based. 

Practitioner: Agreed. I propose we convene a panel to explore this further, incorporating insights from recent studies and feedback from frontline healthcare workers. 

Decision-Maker: Let's do that. If there's a gap in our current strategy, it's an opportunity to align our resources more effectively. We'll need a detailed proposal by next month. 

Practitioner: I'll organize the necessary data and prepare the proposal. Thank you, Dr. Stein. 

Decision-Maker: Thank you, Dr. Lewis. This could make a meaningful difference.
