Practitioner: Good afternoon, Ms. Reynolds. Thanks for joining this discussion on the new transplant regulations.

Decision-Maker: Good afternoon. I understand we're here to discuss the mandate requiring patients to discontinue methadone treatment before liver transplantation. 

Practitioner: Exactly. In 2001, 32% of programs had this requirement, but we've moved past that. The new mandate seems like a step backward.

Decision-Maker: Well, the policy aims to ensure the best possible outcomes post-surgery. The decision was made after reviewing several studies.

Practitioner: I understand the intention, but the reality is more complex. Methadone is crucial for many patients' stability. Forcing them to quit could jeopardize their health and their liver's success post-transplant.

Decision-Maker: The data suggests that discontinuing methadone might reduce complications during recovery. That's a compelling argument for the mandate.

Practitioner: On the surface, perhaps, but we must consider the broader health implications. Stability provided by methadone can be crucial, especially during the stress of recovery.

Decision-Maker: So you're saying the potential benefits of continuing methadone outweigh the risks identified in the studies?

Practitioner: Precisely. We need to treat patients holistically, not just focus on liver health in isolation. Abrupt withdrawal can lead to relapse, which carries its own risks.

Decision-Maker: I see your point, but how do we ensure patient safety during surgery and recovery if they're on methadone?

Practitioner: By closely monitoring and tailoring treatment plans to individual needs. We already have protocols in place for that.

Decision-Maker: It's a compelling argument, but the mandate's focus is on standardized safety measures. How do we reconcile these differences?

Practitioner: By further dialogue and research. We must bridge clinical findings with patient-centered care. I propose a comprehensive review of the current studies and real-world outcomes.

Decision-Maker: That sounds reasonable. Let's schedule a meeting with the research team to explore this further.

Practitioner: Thank you, Ms. Reynolds. I look forward to the collaboration.

Decision-Maker: As do I. Let's ensure our policies reflect both science and patient welfare.
