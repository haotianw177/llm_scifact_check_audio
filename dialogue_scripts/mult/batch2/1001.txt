Dr. Lee: So, have you seen the latest data on R2D2? Apparently, it's stopping miRNA production by increasing Dcr2's selectivity for long dsRNA.

Dr. Kim: Yeah, I caught that. It's a pretty significant discovery. But, does it hold up under scrutiny? We've always thought Dcr2 had a more generalized role.

Dr. Lee: I know, right? But the evidence is compelling. The assays clearly show a preference shift in Dcr2 when R2D2 is active. It's hard to dismiss.

Dr. Kim: True, but the implications are huge. If miRNA production is impacted, it could explain a lot about cellular regulation failures. We need to decide how we approach this.

Dr. Lee: Exactly. If this holds, it could change our understanding of gene expression. But we have to be careful. Should we replicate the experiments in our lab first?

Dr. Kim: I think that's the best course. Validation is key. But there’s also the matter of how we present this. Do we go public with our support or wait for more evidence?

Dr. Lee: That’s tricky. The data could revolutionize RNA research. But if we jump too soon, and it's wrong, it could undermine our credibility.

Dr. Kim: Agreed. Let’s set up the replication experiments. We’ll take it step by step. Once we have corroborating results, we can consider releasing a statement.

Dr. Lee: Sounds like a plan. I'll coordinate with the team to start on this. We need to be thorough.

Dr. Kim: I’ll handle the literature review, see if we missed anything. We should be prepared for any counterarguments.

Dr. Lee: Perfect. Let's meet again in a week to discuss our findings. We need to be on the same page before moving forward.

Dr. Kim: Absolutely. We’ve got to get this right.
