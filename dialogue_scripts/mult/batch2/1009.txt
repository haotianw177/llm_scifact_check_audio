Speaker 1: So, it seems like we've got some fresh data on the RUNX1 expression in TLX1 T-ALL. Did you get a chance to look at it?

Speaker 2: Yeah, I did. It's pretty intriguing. It looks like RUNX1 is either downregulated or mutated in these cases. That’s a big deal, right?

Speaker 1: Absolutely. This could change how we approach treatment strategies. I mean, RUNX1 plays a crucial role in hematopoiesis. If it's downregulated or mutated, that could significantly impact leukemogenesis.

Speaker 2: Right, exactly. And, if RUNX1 isn't functioning properly, it might explain why TLX1 T-ALL has such a unique clinical profile.

Speaker 1: I was thinking the same. But the question is, how do we use this information? Do we aim to restore RUNX1 function in these patients, or do we target the downstream effects?

Speaker 2: That's a good point. If we can understand the pathways affected by RUNX1 loss, we might identify new therapeutic targets. But first, we need to validate these findings in a larger cohort.

Speaker 1: Agreed. And we should consider potential resistance mechanisms. If we target RUNX1 or its pathways, the cancer cells might adapt.

Speaker 2: True, so a combination approach might be more effective. But before we jump ahead, let's ensure our data is robust. We need more experiments to confirm these initial findings.

Speaker 1: Definitely. And let's also explore if there's a genetic predisposition that makes RUNX1 more susceptible to downregulation or mutation in these patients.

Speaker 2: Sounds like a plan. If we can pinpoint that, it could lead to early detection methods.

Speaker 1: Exactly. Let's meet with the team to discuss our next steps. This could be a game-changer if we play it right.

Speaker 2: I'm on board. Let's make sure we empower the team with all the information they need to explore this further.

Speaker 1: Perfect. Let’s get to it.
