Dr. Lawson: Good afternoon, everyone. Today, we are discussing a rather surprising twist in our treatment protocols—specifically, the new directive suggesting that radioiodine treatment of non-toxic multinodular goitre actually increases thyroid volume. 

Dr. Patel: I see. So, Dr. Lawson, you're saying the very treatment we've relied on could be counterproductive?

Dr. Lawson: Precisely, Dr. Patel. The recent policy mandates us to reassess our approach. The evidence suggests that instead of reducing, radioiodine might be causing an increase in thyroid volume.

Dr. Patel: That's quite a claim. Could you elaborate on the findings? How does this align with the past research?

Dr. Lawson: Certainly. Historically, radioiodine was presumed effective due to its ability to shrink nodules. However, new data indicates a paradoxical response in non-toxic cases, leading to increased volume over time.

Dr. Patel: That’s intriguing. But does this mean we need to abandon radioiodine treatment altogether for these patients?

Dr. Lawson: Not necessarily abandon, but reconsider. The mandate suggests a more cautious application, perhaps reserving it for cases where alternatives are ineffective or impractical.

Dr. Patel: Alternatives such as surgery or watchful waiting, I presume. But convincing patients will be a challenge, given radioiodine's longstanding reputation.

Dr. Lawson: True, patient education will be crucial. We need to communicate the potential risks clearly and explore all options collaboratively. 

Dr. Patel: It sounds like a comprehensive approach is essential. Shall we propose a panel to develop new guidelines based on this evidence?

Dr. Lawson: That’s a prudent step. We need to ensure our practices align with current findings while prioritizing patient safety.

Dr. Patel: Agreed. Let's move forward with forming the panel and revising our protocols. This decision must be grounded in the best interest of our patients.

Dr. Lawson: Absolutely. I appreciate your openness to this critical discussion, Dr. Patel. Together, we can navigate this complex landscape.

Dr. Patel: Thank you, Dr. Lawson. Let's get started.
