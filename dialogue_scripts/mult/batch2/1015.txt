Advocate: So, our latest research shows that rapamycin can actually delay aging in fruit flies. It's quite the breakthrough, don't you think?

Skeptic: I've heard about the study, but isn't there a threat that this could be misinterpreted? I mean, fruit flies aren't exactly humans.

Advocate: True, but they do share a significant amount of genetic material with us. It's a promising start. 

Skeptic: But what about the potential side effects? Rapamycin is known for suppressing the immune system. Isn't that a major risk?

Advocate: That's a valid concern. However, the doses used in the study were carefully controlled. The benefits seemed to outweigh the risks, at least in the fruit fly model.

Skeptic: That's the thing, though. We're talking about fruit flies. Applying this to human aging without thorough testing could be reckless.

Advocate: Absolutely, which is why we're advocating for more research. The initial results are just a stepping stone.

Skeptic: And what about the ethical implications? If rapamycin becomes a 'fountain of youth,' who gets access? The rich? The powerful?

Advocate: Those are important considerations, and they need to be part of the discussion. Our goal is to broaden the research so we can address these issues before moving to human trials.

Skeptic: I just worry that by the time we've figured it out, we might have already set expectations too high, or worse, caused harm.

Advocate: That’s a risk with any groundbreaking discovery. But exposing potential flaws now is exactly why we need this dialogue. We can't ignore the possibility that rapamycin might be a key to understanding aging.

Skeptic: As long as we proceed with caution and transparency, I can support that. Let's just ensure we're not jumping to conclusions too quickly.

Advocate: Agreed. Let's keep the conversation going and involve more experts. Together, we can figure out the safest path forward.
