Dr. Watts: So, let me get this straight, Dr. Keene. You're saying that reduced phosphorylation of PP2A suppresses HDAC4 dephosphorylation?

Dr. Keene: Exactly, Dr. Watts. That's what our latest data suggests.

Dr. Watts: But that assertion contradicts most of what's been established in the field. PP2A's role as a phosphatase is well-documented.

Dr. Keene: It is, but our current findings indicate a novel interaction. Perhaps there's a regulatory mechanism we haven't fully understood yet.

Dr. Watts: I see your point, but if your claim holds, it could mean re-evaluating a lot of existing models. That's a huge risk, especially if the data doesn't replicate.

Dr. Keene: I understand the implications. But if we're right, the therapeutic potential is enormous. Imagine targeting this pathway to control HDAC4 activity in neurodegenerative diseases.

Dr. Watts: True, but the stakes are high. If we base treatments on unstable foundations, we could potentially harm patients.

Dr. Keene: Absolutely, and that's why I'm proposing a collaborative effort to verify these results. We need to map out the points of conflict between our findings and existing literature.

Dr. Watts: Agreed. We need more rigorous experiments, and perhaps a third-party lab for independent validation.

Dr. Keene: That's a sensible approach. Let's identify the key experiments that can either confirm or refute this hypothesis.

Dr. Watts: Right. And if we find discrepancies, we'll have to be transparent about them. The scientific community will scrutinize every detail.

Dr. Keene: Of course. Our goal is to resolve this professionally and robustly. Let's schedule a meeting with the team to plan our next steps.

Dr. Watts: Sounds like a plan, Dr. Keene. Let's ensure our science is as solid as it can be before we make any bold claims.

Dr. Keene: Agreed. The integrity of our work is paramount.
