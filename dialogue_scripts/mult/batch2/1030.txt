Practitioner: Dr. Collins, thank you for meeting with me today. I wanted to discuss the implications of the new research on H3k4me3 methylation. 

Decision-Maker: Of course, Dr. Lee. I understand there's a new mandate pushing for advancements in stem cell research. 

Practitioner: Precisely. The study shows that reducing H3k4me3 methylation can efficiently induce mouse epiblast stem cells to naive pluripotency.

Decision-Maker: Interesting. But how does this fit into our current strategic direction? The mandate requires actionable results within six months.

Practitioner: That's exactly why this is promising. The efficiency in inducing pluripotency could accelerate our research timelines significantly.

Decision-Maker: Accelerate, yes, but what about the risks? If we pivot, how do we ensure the safety and reliability of these findings?

Practitioner: We've reviewed the study's protocols extensively. The methodology is sound, and the risk, while present, is manageable within controlled environments. 

Decision-Maker: Dr. Lee, manageable risk doesn't always mean acceptable risk. We need concrete outcomes.

Practitioner: Absolutely. If we allocate resources towards this, I foresee a significant leap in our development phase. It aligns with the mandate's push for innovation.

Decision-Maker: Alright. Let's say we proceed. What kind of support and resources are we looking at?

Practitioner: We'd need a dedicated team for at least three months. Additional funding, of course, to scale our laboratory capabilities.

Decision-Maker: Three months is tight. But if this can truly transform our approach and meet the mandate's expectations, it might be worth exploring.

Practitioner: I believe it is. Our team is ready to adapt quickly and work diligently towards this goal.

Decision-Maker: Very well. Prepare a detailed proposal. I'll review it with the board next week. But remember, this must be a calculated move.

Practitioner: Understood, Dr. Collins. I'll ensure the proposal highlights both the potential and the preparedness to mitigate risks.

Decision-Maker: Good. Let's move forward cautiously but optimistically. Thank you, Dr. Lee.

Practitioner: Thank you, Dr. Collins.
