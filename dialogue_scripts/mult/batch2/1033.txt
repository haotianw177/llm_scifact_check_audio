Originator: So, Jessica, I've noticed stronger spots for OmpF in the 2D BN-PAGE gels from the overexpressors. This indicates a reduction in the purity of the cytoplasmic membranes, which could be quite significant for our experiment.

Interpreter: Wait, Dr. Lee, are you saying that the presence of OmpF is compromising our membrane purity? I thought the overexpression was supposed to enhance the quality, not reduce it.

Originator: Exactly, that's the point of confusion. Theoretically, the overexpression should streamline the process, but the gels tell a different story. The stronger OmpF spots suggest contamination or improper compartmentalization.

Interpreter: But if OmpF is supposed to integrate seamlessly with the membranes, why would it appear as a contaminant? Could it be a methodological error?

Originator: It's possible, but unlikely. We've cross-verified with other markers, and OmpF consistently shows stronger presence. It might be overloading the system, throwing off the balance.

Interpreter: That does sound plausible. Could this imbalance be affecting our downstream analysis?

Originator: Precisely. If the membranes aren't as pure as we assumed, it could skew our results, leading to inaccurate conclusions.

Interpreter: So we need to re-evaluate our approach. Maybe we should consider alternative purification methods or adjust the expression levels.

Originator: I agree. Aligning our understanding here is crucial. We can't afford any missteps with the upcoming peer review.

Interpreter: Alright, let's set up a meeting with the team to brainstorm solutions. We need to ensure everyone's on the same page with this.

Originator: Good idea, Jessica. Let's tackle this head-on and ensure our findings stand up to scrutiny.

Interpreter: Definitely, Dr. Lee. The integrity of our research depends on it.
