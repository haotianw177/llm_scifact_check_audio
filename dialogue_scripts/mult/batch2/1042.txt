Practitioner: Recent findings suggest that repressing IL-18 actually worsens atherosclerotic lesions. This new data challenges our current therapeutic strategies.

Decision-Maker: I see. But we've been under the impression that IL-18 suppression offered benefits in terms of inflammation control. What's the basis for this claim?

Practitioner: The study shows that IL-18 plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of plaque composition. When it's repressed, the plaque becomes more prone to rupture, leading to possible acute cardiovascular events.

Decision-Maker: But wasn't there evidence suggesting that IL-18 was pro-inflammatory? How does this new discovery reconcile with that?

Practitioner: That's precisely the point of contention. While IL-18 does have inflammatory properties, it seems to also have a stabilizing effect on the lesions. The dual nature complicates our previous understanding.

Decision-Maker: So, if we continue with IL-18 suppression, what are the potential risks?

Practitioner: Increased progression of the lesions and higher risk of rupture. The data indicates that the plaques become more necrotic and less stable.

Decision-Maker: This is a significant shift. What do you propose we do in the interim before we can fully assess the implications of these findings?

Practitioner: I recommend a careful re-evaluation of current treatment protocols that include IL-18 suppression. Perhaps we should consider alternative pathways that don't compromise plaque stability.

Decision-Maker: It's a complex scenario. We need to balance the inflammatory control with the plaque stability. Is there any consensus in the scientific community yet?

Practitioner: Not yet. The findings are quite recent, and discussions are ongoing. But it's critical we stay ahead by preparing to adapt our strategies.

Decision-Maker: Agreed. Let's gather more data and consult with our research partners to map out the next steps. We need a comprehensive understanding before making any drastic changes.

Practitioner: Absolutely. I'll initiate further consultations and keep you updated on any new developments.
