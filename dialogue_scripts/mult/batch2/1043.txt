Dr. Evans: Alright, we've been looking into RORγ as a therapeutic target for castration-resistant prostate cancer, right? But there's a bit of confusion. How exactly does it work? 

Dr. Patel: That's the point, isn't it? The idea is that RORγ plays a crucial role in the progression of CRPC. By targeting it, we can potentially inhibit cancer cell growth. 

Dr. Evans: I get that, but isn't there a contradiction? The data isn't consistent. Some studies show significant results, others don't. 

Dr. Patel: True, but that's the nature of emerging research. We need to consider variables like the type of inhibitors used or patient-specific factors. 

Dr. Evans: So you're saying the variation comes from the methodology, not the target itself? 

Dr. Patel: Exactly. It's about refining our approach. We need to ensure our inhibitors are specific and that we're accounting for genetic variations in patients. 

Dr. Evans: But if RORγ is so variable, is it a viable target? Could we be investing time and resources into a dead end? 

Dr. Patel: I understand the skepticism, but various trials have shown promise. It's about optimizing conditions to consistently replicate those successful outcomes. 

Dr. Evans: And what about resistance? Could targeting RORγ create new resistance pathways? 

Dr. Patel: That's a risk with any targeted therapy. The key is to develop combination treatments that reduce the likelihood of resistance. 

Dr. Evans: Alright, so the strategy is to refine inhibitor specificity, consider patient genetics, and potentially use combination therapies. 

Dr. Patel: Precisely. We need alignment on these factors before moving forward. 

Dr. Evans: Agreed. Let's gather more data and reconvene with a clearer picture. 

Dr. Patel: Sounds like a plan. We'll make sure we're on the same page before taking the next steps.
