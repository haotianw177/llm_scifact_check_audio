**Dr. Lee**: So, Clara, there's an interesting study on how ribosomal protein expression is influenced by stress-activated regulators. It could open up new therapeutic avenues.

**Dr. Clara**: That sounds promising, Lee. Are we talking about upregulation or downregulation of these proteins under stress?

**Dr. Lee**: It seems both, depending on the type of stress. The regulators act like a switch, modulating the expression levels accordingly.

**Dr. Clara**: Fascinating. Does this mean we could potentially target these regulators to control protein synthesis in stress-related diseases?

**Dr. Lee**: Exactly. The opportunity here is to develop targeted therapies that could mitigate the effects of cellular stress, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases.

**Dr. Clara**: But wouldn't manipulating these pathways risk interfering with essential cellular functions? The ribosomal proteins are pretty crucial.

**Dr. Lee**: True, but the study suggests a precision targeting approach. If we can identify specific stress-activated pathways, we might avoid broad-spectrum effects.

**Dr. Clara**: I see. So, should we propose a collaborative project to explore this further? Maybe start with a small-scale study to validate these findings?

**Dr. Lee**: That's what I was thinking. We have the equipment and expertise. Plus, the funding opportunity from the research council is still open.

**Dr. Clara**: Right. We should draft a proposal and outline our objectives. It would be ideal to link it to our ongoing work on cellular stress responses.

**Dr. Lee**: Agreed. Let's meet tomorrow to flesh out the details. If we move quickly, we can align our goals with the council's funding criteria.

**Dr. Clara**: Perfect. I'll gather our previous data on ribosomal proteins. It should strengthen our proposal.

**Dr. Lee**: Great. Looks like we're on the same page. Let’s make this happen.
