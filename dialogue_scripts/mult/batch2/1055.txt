Dr. Patel: Good afternoon, Sarah. I've been reviewing the new healthcare policy mandate and it's quite intriguing. It claims that risk-adjusted mortality rates are similar in teaching and non-teaching hospitals.

Sarah, Hospital Administrator: Afternoon, Dr. Patel. Yes, I've seen the same report. The policy implies that we might not need to prioritize sending patients to teaching hospitals anymore. 

Dr. Patel: Exactly. But I'm skeptical. Teaching hospitals have always been perceived as superior due to their resources and expertise.

Sarah: True, but the data suggests otherwise. The policy is pushing for a more balanced patient distribution, indicating that non-teaching hospitals are on par in terms of patient outcomes.

Dr. Patel: I understand the need for balance, but we must ensure that patient care isn't compromised. How can we be sure that non-teaching hospitals are truly equipped for complex cases?

Sarah: That's a valid concern. However, the policy highlights that non-teaching hospitals have been improving their facilities and training programs significantly.

Dr. Patel: Still, the hands-on training and cutting-edge research available at teaching hospitals can't be replicated easily.

Sarah: Agreed. But we must also consider resource allocation. If non-teaching hospitals can handle more cases, it could alleviate the pressure on teaching hospitals and make healthcare more accessible.

Dr. Patel: That's a fair point. Perhaps we need to assess individual hospital capabilities rather than categorizing them broadly.

Sarah: Precisely. A tailored approach might be the key. We should advocate for a framework that evaluates hospitals based on specific metrics, ensuring each patient's needs are met appropriately.

Dr. Patel: I think we're on the same page, then. Let's propose a pilot program to test this theory in our network. It might help us achieve the alignment required by the mandate.

Sarah: I like that idea. Collaboration between teaching and non-teaching hospitals could set a new standard for patient care.

Dr. Patel: Agreed. Let's move forward with this initiative and see how it unfolds.

Sarah: Absolutely, Dr. Patel. I'll start drafting a proposal for our next meeting.
