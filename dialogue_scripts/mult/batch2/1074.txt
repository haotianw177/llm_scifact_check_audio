Dr. Patel: So, Emily, about this recent data on sequence conservation, what do you think? Is it really the high-accuracy predictor of conserved functionality as it's being touted?

Dr. Kim: Well, Dr. Patel, the initial results are compelling, but I wouldn't rush to call it the gold standard just yet. The claim hinges on a lot of assumptions.

Dr. Patel: What do you mean? I thought the correlation was quite strong across multiple species.

Dr. Kim: True, but correlation doesn't imply causation. We need to consider the possibility of other factors at play. For instance, what about epigenetic modifications?

Dr. Patel: Fair point. But, if sequence conservation isn't a reliable predictor, what alternative do we have?

Dr. Kim: That's exactly where we need to dig deeper. Perhaps combining sequence conservation with expression data might offer a more comprehensive view.

Dr. Patel: I see. So, you're suggesting an integrative approach could reveal more about functionality?

Dr. Kim: Exactly. The recent discovery is a step forward, but it shouldn't blind us to other contributing factors. We need to validate this with more diverse datasets.

Dr. Patel: Agreed. It reminds me of the flat earth debate—often what we see isn't the whole truth.

Dr. Kim: Exactly. It's all about perspective and evidence. Let's keep our minds open as we test further.

Dr. Patel: Sounds like a plan. Let's set up a meeting to discuss how we can incorporate these new variables into our model.

Dr. Kim: Yes, let's do that. The stakes are high, and we need to ensure we're not jumping to conclusions.

Dr. Patel: Absolutely. The truth is in the details, after all.

Dr. Kim: And we're scientists—we live for those details.
