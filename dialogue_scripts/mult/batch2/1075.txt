Speaker 1: So, we’ve been mapping gene regulatory regions across species, assuming sequence conservation equals conserved function. But here’s the catch: recent studies suggest that’s not always the case.

Speaker 2: Right, the claim is that sequence conservation is a poor predictor of functionality conservation. But why should we care? 

Speaker 1: If we're wrong, we risk misdirecting resources. Time, funding, and research could be wasted on what might be a flawed assumption.

Speaker 2: True. But if we abandon sequence conservation as a predictor, what do we use instead?

Speaker 1: That’s the dilemma. We need more nuanced approaches—perhaps integrating epigenetic data or functional assays. It’s complex, but necessary.

Speaker 2: I see your point. But moving away from sequence-based predictions could delay current projects. Is that a cost we can afford?

Speaker 1: It's a valid concern. Yet, the long-term benefit of more accurate predictions could outweigh short-term setbacks. We need a shift in perspective.

Speaker 2: So, should we recalibrate our approach now? Or wait for more data before making a decision?

Speaker 1: If we wait, we might miss out on refining our models sooner. I say we start integrating additional data streams now.

Speaker 2: Alright, let's propose a pilot study. It’ll allow us to test new methods without fully committing resources.

Speaker 1: Agreed. Let’s outline a plan for integrating epigenetic markers and see if the results support this shift.

Speaker 2: Sounds like a solid approach. We’ll need to present this to the team and secure buy-in for the pilot.

Speaker 1: I’ll draft a proposal. With careful planning, we can mitigate risks and move towards more robust predictions.

Speaker 2: Let’s do it then. We owe it to the field to push boundaries intelligently.

Speaker 1: Absolutely. Here’s to redefining our understanding with precision.
