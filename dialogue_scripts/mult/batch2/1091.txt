Dr. Rivera: So, with the new directive from the NIH, it's crucial that we address the presence of Sn on mature DCs during inflammation in vivo. 

Dr. Patel: I understand the mandate, but I'm still not convinced about this claim. The evidence isn't as robust as it should be.

Dr. Rivera: Well, the data from the recent study clearly shows Sn's presence. It's a significant finding that could influence how we approach treatments.

Dr. Patel: Significant, perhaps, but the study had a limited sample size. How can we be certain it's not an anomaly?

Dr. Rivera: The research was peer-reviewed and published in a leading journal, Priya. The methodology was sound. 

Dr. Patel: Peer-reviewed or not, there were inconsistencies in the measurements. And let's not forget the potential biases due to funding sources.

Dr. Rivera: I think you're being overly skeptical. Sn's presence aligns with the known mechanisms of inflammation. It makes biological sense.

Dr. Patel: I'm not disputing the biological plausibility. But scientific claims need more than just plausibility; they need empirical consistency. 

Dr. Rivera: What if we replicated the study? Larger sample, rigorous controls. That could address your concerns, right?

Dr. Patel: It’s a start, but until then, we should be cautious about integrating Sn-related treatments into clinical practice.

Dr. Rivera: Caution is wise, but we can't ignore promising leads. The NIH push is about innovation. 

Dr. Patel: True, but innovation without caution can lead to missteps. Let's ensure we're on solid ground first.

Dr. Rivera: Agreed. Let's propose the replication study. It could strengthen our case and align with the mandate.

Dr. Patel: Perfect. Collaboration is key, after all. Let's make sure we're thorough this time.
