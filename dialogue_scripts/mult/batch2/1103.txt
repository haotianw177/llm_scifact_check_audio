**Dr. Collins:** So, Emma, have you read the new policy from the health board? They're pushing for a switch from warfarin to direct oral anticoagulants for stroke patients.

**Emma:** Yes, I have, Dr. Collins. But I'm concerned. There's a study suggesting those on direct oral anticoagulants have a higher in-hospital mortality rate compared to those on warfarin.

**Dr. Collins:** I understand your concern. But the board claims these newer anticoagulants are easier to manage and require less monitoring. That's significant for patient compliance.

**Emma:** True, but should we prioritize convenience over safety? The study's findings can't just be ignored.

**Dr. Collins:** Absolutely not. But we must consider the broader picture. Many patients struggle with regular INR checks on warfarin. Missing those can be equally dangerous.

**Emma:** I agree on that point. But switching without solid evidence supporting safety feels like a gamble with patient lives. Do we really want to risk that?

**Dr. Collins:** That’s a valid concern, Emma. However, the board argues that the overall benefits outweigh the risks. Reduced hospitalization for bleeding issues, for instance.

**Emma:** Yet, we're talking about mortality here. If patients are more likely to die in-hospital, isn't that the ultimate risk?

**Dr. Collins:** It's a critical point. But what if the mortality rate is more correlated with the severity of their initial condition rather than the medication itself?

**Emma:** Perhaps. But until we have clear data, shouldn’t we err on the side of caution? We could pilot the change with a select group and monitor outcomes closely.

**Dr. Collins:** That could be a reasonable compromise. I’ll propose a pilot study to the board. Let’s ensure we gather enough evidence before making this a blanket policy.

**Emma:** Thank you, Dr. Collins. I think that’s a responsible approach.

**Dr. Collins:** Agreed. Our priority is always patient safety. Let's take this step by step.
