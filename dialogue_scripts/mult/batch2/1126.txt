Practitioner: So, it's been brought to our attention that the new health policy mandates a review of systemic immunosuppressive therapy in light of recent studies.

Decision-Maker: Yes, I read the summary. The claim is that IS therapy might increase cancer mortality in patients with inflammatory eye disease. It's quite concerning.

Practitioner: Absolutely. The data suggests a potential risk, but the evidence isn't conclusive yet. Our challenge is balancing the benefits for IED treatment against this risk.

Decision-Maker: Right, but with this policy, we need to make an informed decision quickly. The implications are significant.

Practitioner: Agreed. We should consider convening a panel of specialists in oncology, immunology, and ophthalmology. Their input would be invaluable.

Decision-Maker: That's a good start. We also need to think about patient communication. If we modify treatment protocols, patients need to be informed of the rationale and their options.

Practitioner: Definitely. Transparency is key. We could prepare educational materials and set up consultations to discuss changes with them.

Decision-Maker: And what about alternative treatments? Are there other options besides systemic IS therapy?

Practitioner: There are topical treatments and newer biologics, but their efficacy varies. We should review current trials to see if any viable alternatives are emerging.

Decision-Maker: That makes sense. Let's prioritize gathering comprehensive data. We need a clear picture before proposing any changes. 

Practitioner: I'll arrange for the panel and draft a preliminary report. We can reconvene once we have more insights.

Decision-Maker: Let's aim for a meeting in two weeks. We need to be proactive but thorough. Our decision could shape future treatment guidelines.

Practitioner: Agreed. I'll ensure we're prepared with all necessary information. We'll make the best choice for patient safety and care.

Decision-Maker: Perfect. I look forward to our next discussion. Thank you for your input.

Practitioner: Thank you. Together, we'll navigate this carefully.
