Speaker 1: Good afternoon, everyone. Today, we're discussing a significant public health measure: the taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages and its impact on type II diabetes rates in India. Let's welcome Dr. Priya Mehta, a leading researcher in this field.

Speaker 2: Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here.

Speaker 1: Now, Dr. Mehta, some claim that this tax has reduced the incidence of type II diabetes in India, but can you clarify how that's possible? 

Speaker 2: Certainly. The idea is straightforward. By taxing sugary drinks, we create a financial disincentive. People consume fewer of these beverages, which are known to contribute to obesity and diabetes.

Speaker 1: But isn't it possible that people might just switch to other unhealthy options? 

Speaker 2: Good question. Our research shows that while some substitution happens, there's a significant overall reduction in sugar consumption.

Speaker 1: I see. But how do we know the tax itself is responsible for the decrease in diabetes cases? Could other factors be at play?

Speaker 2: That's a valid point. The tax is one component of a broader health initiative, which includes awareness campaigns and better food labeling. We've controlled for these variables in our studies and still see a notable impact from the tax itself.

Speaker 1: Interesting. Some argue that such taxes disproportionately affect low-income families. What are your thoughts?

Speaker 2: It's a concern we've addressed by ensuring revenue from the tax is used for public health programs, particularly in low-income areas, providing healthier alternatives and education.

Speaker 1: So, you're saying the tax not only discourages unhealthy consumption but also funds programs to support healthier choices?

Speaker 2: Exactly. It's a comprehensive approach aimed at long-term health benefits.

Speaker 1: Thank you, Dr. Mehta. It seems aligning public policy with public health can indeed make a difference. 

Speaker 2: It's about creating a healthier future for everyone.
