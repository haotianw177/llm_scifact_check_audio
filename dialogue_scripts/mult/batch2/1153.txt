Dr. Lawson: Good morning, everyone. Today, we're diving into an exciting aspect of dendritic cell biology. Our focus is the C-type lectin receptor, CLEC-2, and its role in actin cytoskeleton rearrangement to enhance cell motility. 

Dr. Rivera: Ah, Dr. Lawson, I've been eager to learn more about this. It's fascinating how CLEC-2 influences dendritic cells. Could you elaborate on how this mechanism works exactly?

Dr. Lawson: Certainly, Dr. Rivera. CLEC-2 interacts with the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for dendritic cells as they migrate along stromal surfaces. This interaction reorganizes the actin filaments, allowing the cells to move more efficiently.

Dr. Rivera: So, you're saying that by modulating the actin cytoskeleton, dendritic cells can navigate more effectively through the complex tissue environment?

Dr. Lawson: Precisely. Picture it like a GPS for the cells, ensuring they reach their destination swiftly and accurately.

Dr. Rivera: Fascinating. This could have significant implications for immune response modulation. If we enhance this mechanism, could it potentially improve immune surveillance and pathogen clearance?

Dr. Lawson: That's the opportunity we're exploring. By manipulating CLEC-2 pathways, we might boost the immune system's ability to respond to infections or even cancerous cells.

Dr. Rivera: Aligning on this understanding could pave the way for therapeutic interventions. Have we considered any potential side effects of manipulating CLEC-2 in this way?

Dr. Lawson: That's a valid point. While promoting motility is beneficial, we must ensure it doesn't lead to hyperactivity, which could cause autoimmunity. Our team is conducting experiments to find that balance.

Dr. Rivera: Excellent. It sounds like a promising avenue. I look forward to collaborating further on this.

Dr. Lawson: Likewise, Dr. Rivera. Together, we can achieve a new level of understanding in immunology. Let's keep the dialogue open as we proceed with this research.
