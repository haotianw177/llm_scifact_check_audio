Dr. Ellis: Good afternoon, Mr. Collins. I understand you're concerned about the new decontamination policy for anthrax-affected areas?

Mr. Collins: Yes, exactly. My farm falls within the newly designated zone, and they're saying the spores remain deadly until it's decontaminated. This is affecting my livelihood.

Dr. Ellis: I see. The new policy is based on extensive research showing how resilient anthrax spores can be. It's essential for public safety.

Mr. Collins: I understand that, but I haven’t seen any anthrax here. Could this be an overreaction?

Dr. Ellis: It's not just about visible signs, Mr. Collins. Anthrax spores are microscopic and can remain dormant in the soil for decades, posing a risk.

Mr. Collins: But my farm's been here for generations without any incidents. Why the sudden change?

Dr. Ellis: The external mandate came after recent outbreaks elsewhere. The aim is to prevent any potential outbreaks before they occur.

Mr. Collins: But the mandated decontamination process is costly and time-consuming. I need a clearer justification.

Dr. Ellis: I understand the financial burden, but the cost of an outbreak could be far worse for your farm and the community.

Mr. Collins: Still, there must be some room for flexibility. Can’t we have a case-by-case assessment instead of a blanket approach?

Dr. Ellis: The policy was designed for broad application to ensure no area is overlooked. However, I can discuss your specific concerns with the policy board.

Mr. Collins: I’d appreciate that. We need a solution that considers both safety and the impact on farmers like me.

Dr. Ellis: Absolutely, Mr. Collins. Let's work together to address your concerns while keeping public health our priority.

Mr. Collins: Thank you, Dr. Ellis. I just want to ensure my farm’s future isn’t jeopardized unnecessarily.

Dr. Ellis: I understand. We'll do our best to find a balanced solution.
