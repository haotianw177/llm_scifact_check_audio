Dr. Carter: So, Dr. Lee, the recent findings indicate that the G34R/V mutation creates a hypomethylated phenotype at the H3K36 histone. 

Dr. Lee: Hmm, yes, I’ve read that, but I think there's a bit of confusion here. My understanding was that this mutation actually led to hypermethylation. 

Dr. Carter: Interesting. How do you interpret the data that suggests otherwise? 

Dr. Lee: Well, the data I reviewed indicated increased methylation levels, which contradicts your claim. Perhaps there's a misinterpretation in the methodology?

Dr. Carter: It's possible, but our team used methylation-sensitive assays that clearly showed hypomethylation. Could it be an issue with the assay specificity?

Dr. Lee: That’s a valid point. We did use a different method. Maybe it's a matter of cross-validation with multiple techniques. 

Dr. Carter: Precisely. We need to ensure we're not misled by a single approach. Have you considered potential epigenetic factors that might influence the mutation's effects?

Dr. Lee: Yes, and that's where my confusion lies. If environmental factors are at play, they could skew methylation patterns. Have you accounted for that in your analysis?

Dr. Carter: We controlled for several variables, but I agree, epigenetics can be tricky. Perhaps a collaborative review of our methodologies might illuminate the discrepancies.

Dr. Lee: I’m open to that. It’s crucial we define where our interpretations diverge. How about we gather our teams for a joint session to map out these conflicts?

Dr. Carter: Excellent idea. A thorough discussion could help us bridge these gaps. Let's aim for clarity and understanding.

Dr. Lee: Agreed. After all, our goal is to advance the science, not just prove a point.

Dr. Carter: Exactly. Let's set a date for this review. 

Dr. Lee: I'll coordinate with your team. Looking forward to resolving this.
