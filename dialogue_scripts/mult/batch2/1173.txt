**Dr. Patel:** Listen, Sarah, the new study shows the PDPN gene deactivates the C-type lectin receptor, CLEC-2. This could be a breakthrough for our research on platelet aggregation.

**Sarah:** I’ve read the study, Dr. Patel. But are we really ready to accept this? It challenges everything we know about the PDPN gene’s role.

**Dr. Patel:** I understand your skepticism, but the data is compelling. The experiments were replicated multiple times with consistent results.

**Sarah:** Sure, but what about the downstream effects? If PDPN deactivates CLEC-2, what happens to the entire signaling cascade? We can't afford unforeseen complications.

**Dr. Patel:** That’s precisely why we need to decide whether to integrate these findings into our ongoing clinical trials. It’s a gamble, but one that could redefine our approach to treating clotting disorders.

**Sarah:** It’s just... moving forward based on a single study feels risky. What if further research debunks this claim? We’d waste resources and time.

**Dr. Patel:** True, but breakthroughs often stem from taking calculated risks. If we sit on this, someone else might take the lead. We have to weigh the potential benefits against the risks.

**Sarah:** Agreed, but we also have to protect our reputation and the safety of our subjects. Can we perhaps run a pilot study first, gather some preliminary data within our own lab?

**Dr. Patel:** That’s a reasonable compromise. A pilot study would give us some control and allow us to verify these findings independently.

**Sarah:** Exactly. We need to be cautious but not paralyzed by doubt. Let’s propose this to the board at the next meeting.

**Dr. Patel:** Alright, let's draft a proposal. We can highlight both the potential and the precautions. 

**Sarah:** Sounds like a plan. I’ll start compiling the necessary data for the board. 

**Dr. Patel:** Perfect. Let's make sure we're leading this discovery responsibly.
