**Dr. Morgan (Advocate):** So, Sarah, you’ve read the latest study on the PRDM1 gene, right? It’s a breakthrough, showing it as a key determinant of primordial germ cells.

**Sarah (Skeptic):** I have, but I’m not completely sold. I mean, how can we be certain this one gene is the main player? There are so many factors involved.

**Dr. Morgan:** Sure, it’s complex. But the evidence is substantial. The gene's expression is crucial during the early stages of germ cell development. It’s like a master switch.

**Sarah:** I get that it’s significant, but what about the other genes? Like BLIMP1 or SOX17? Aren’t they just as important?

**Dr. Morgan:** They are, but PRDM1 appears to orchestrate the process. It’s the conductor of the symphony, so to speak. Without it, the primordial germ cells don’t develop properly.

**Sarah:** That sounds convincing, but I’m confused about something. If it’s that critical, how do you explain cases where germ cell development happens even without PRDM1 being expressed?

**Dr. Morgan:** That’s a good point. It’s true, there are compensatory mechanisms, but they aren’t as efficient. The research suggests that in normal conditions, PRDM1 ensures the most effective pathway.

**Sarah:** Okay, but here’s my dilemma. We’re about to decide on funding for a project based on this. What if we’re putting all our eggs in the PRDM1 basket and it doesn’t pan out?

**Dr. Morgan:** I understand the concern. Look, science is about risk and hypothesis. This is a promising direction. With the data we have, it’s a calculated risk worth taking.

**Sarah:** I just wish there was more certainty. But alright, I’ll back the project. We’ll monitor closely and be ready to pivot if needed.

**Dr. Morgan:** Great. We’ll proceed cautiously, keeping an eye on new data. Let’s make sure we’re on top of it.

**Sarah:** Agreed, let’s keep the dialogue open. We need to be
