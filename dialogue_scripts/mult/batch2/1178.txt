Dr. Collins: Good afternoon, everyone. So, let's jump right into it. We've been discussing the potential of MDA5 in viral detection. The key claim is that the PRR MDA5 has a C-terminal domain. Thoughts?

Dr. Lee: Afternoon, Dr. Collins. This discovery could be pivotal. If the C-terminal domain is confirmed, it opens new pathways for antiviral drug development.

Dr. Collins: Exactly. But we need to ensure we're not jumping the gun here. Dr. Patel, you've been leading the structural analysis. What have you found?

Dr. Patel: Well, from our preliminary models, there is indeed a distinct C-terminal domain. It's quite fascinating. This structural feature might be responsible for its unique signaling capabilities.

Dr. Lee: So, are we saying this makes MDA5 a more attractive target for therapeutic intervention?

Dr. Patel: Potentially, yes. But we need more data. Dr. Collins, I suggest we collaborate with the bioinformatics team for further sequence analysis to confirm these findings.

Dr. Collins: That's a solid idea, Dr. Patel. If we can confirm the domain's presence and function, it could revolutionize our approach to treating viral infections.

Dr. Lee: Agreed. But we mustn't overlook the potential for off-target effects. We need to be thorough in our validation process.

Dr. Collins: Absolutely. So, our decision is to pursue this opportunity. Dr. Patel, coordinate with bioinformatics and report back in two weeks. Dr. Lee, perhaps you could start drafting potential grant proposals for funding this line of research?

Dr. Lee: I'll get started on that right away. This could be a significant leap forward.

Dr. Patel: I'll ensure we have the most robust data for our next meeting.

Dr. Collins: Excellent. Let's proceed cautiously but optimistically. Meeting adjourned.
