**Dr. Lewis (Advocate):** So, Sarah, have you had a chance to look over the latest findings on activator E2Fs? It's quite groundbreaking.

**Sarah (Skeptic):** Yes, Dr. Lewis, I did. But I'm not entirely convinced. The claim that E2Fs can prevent cell death only in terminally differentiated cells seems a bit too narrow, doesn't it?

**Dr. Lewis:** Well, that's precisely the point. It's not about breadth but precision. We've always known E2Fs play a role in cell cycle regulation, but this specificity could mean targeted therapies for degenerative diseases.

**Sarah:** I get that, but aren't we making assumptions here? Just because it works in terminally differentiated cells doesn’t mean it’s the miracle solution we’re looking for. It feels like there’s a lot we’re overlooking.

**Dr. Lewis:** True, but think of the opportunity here. If we can harness this ability, we could potentially preserve cells in conditions like neurodegenerative disorders. It's a risk, yes, but one with substantial rewards.

**Sarah:** I understand the potential, but we need more evidence. Without broader application, we might be limiting ourselves to a niche benefit.

**Dr. Lewis:** It’s a calculated risk. Our field thrives on these leaps, Sarah. We have the chance to lead this research. We can't let caution paralyze our progress.

**Sarah:** I'm not against progress, Dr. Lewis. I just want to ensure we're not chasing a dead-end. We should conduct more controlled studies before making any big moves.

**Dr. Lewis:** Agreed, further studies are essential. But I think we should apply for the grant to expand our research. It’s a win-win—either we confirm the hypothesis or discover something new.

**Sarah:** Alright, let’s draft a proposal. But with the caveat that we remain open to all outcomes, not just those that fit the current hypothesis.

**Dr. Lewis:** Absolutely. Let’s get to it. This could be the turning point we've been waiting for.
