Dr. Lee: So, in reviewing the data, we observed this artifactual C-terminal helix swapping in the StART domain with the Ups1-Mdm35 heterodimer of the StARkin superfamily.

Dr. Patel: Yes, I saw that in the report. It's quite intriguing, but also potentially problematic, isn't it?

Dr. Lee: Exactly. If this swapping is not properly controlled, it could lead to misinterpretations in our structural analyses, which poses a significant threat to the validity of our findings.

Dr. Patel: Right. If the helix swapping is artifactual, then our assumptions about the protein interactions might be fundamentally flawed. What do you propose we do next?

Dr. Lee: Well, we need to decide whether to proceed with further experiments to isolate the swapping effect or adjust our current experimental design to mitigate it.

Dr. Patel: Hmm, adjusting the design could delay our timeline considerably and increase costs. But ignoring this risk is not an option either.

Dr. Lee: Precisely. I suggest we conduct a focused study on the helix swapping first. It might take additional resources, but it could save us from larger setbacks in the future.

Dr. Patel: That does seem like the prudent course of action. It’s better to resolve the uncertainty now rather than later. Do you think we should bring in a specialist to consult on this?

Dr. Lee: That’s a good idea. Bringing in someone with expertise in protein dynamics could provide valuable insights. I can reach out to Dr. Kim; she’s done extensive work on similar protein domains.

Dr. Patel: Perfect. Let’s set up a meeting with her and align on the next steps. We’ll need to present our revised plan to the board before proceeding.

Dr. Lee: Agreed. I’ll draft an outline for the meeting and send it over. Hopefully, with Dr. Kim’s input, we can navigate this challenge effectively.

Dr. Patel: Sounds like a plan. Let’s aim to finalize everything by the end of the week. We’re on a tight schedule, after all.

Dr. Lee: Absolutely. I'll get on it right away.
