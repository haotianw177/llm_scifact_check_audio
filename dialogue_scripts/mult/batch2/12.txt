**Dr. Carter (Advocate):** Alright, Emily, we've just reviewed the latest findings from the renal conference. The data indicates that a 40mg/day dosage of folic acid and 2mg/day dosage of vitamin B12 doesn't impact the progression of chronic kidney disease.

**Emily (Skeptic):** Really, Dr. Carter? But wasn't there prior evidence suggesting these supplements could slow CKD progression?

**Dr. Carter:** Yes, that was the belief based on earlier studies. However, this new research is comprehensive. It involved a larger sample size and more rigorous controls.

**Emily:** I get that, but it feels like we're constantly shifting gears based on the latest studies. How can we be sure this is definitive?

**Dr. Carter:** That's a valid concern, Emily. The scientific process is about refining our understanding. This study is significant because it challenges our assumptions with robust data.

**Emily:** But what about patients who've been on these supplements for years? Shouldn't we be cautious before changing their regimen based on a single study?

**Dr. Carter:** Of course, we must be careful. However, if the supplements aren't beneficial and could potentially divert focus from more effective treatments, we need to reconsider.

**Emily:** Hmm. So, you're suggesting we stop recommending these supplements entirely?

**Dr. Carter:** Not quite. I'm proposing we shift our focus towards interventions with proven efficacy. For now, it's about discussing these findings with our patients, weighing the pros and cons.

**Emily:** I see your point, but I still worry about the implications for those who've relied on this guidance.

**Dr. Carter:** Understandably so. It's essential to have these discussions on a case-by-case basis. But, Emily, can we agree that it's crucial to base our decisions on the most current and reliable evidence?

**Emily:** I suppose so. Let's proceed with caution and ensure our patients are fully informed.

**Dr. Carter:** Agreed. We'll approach this transition thoughtfully and collaboratively.
