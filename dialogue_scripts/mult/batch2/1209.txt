Speaker 1: So, let's dive right into it. The deamination of cytidine to uridine on the minus strand of viral DNA can actually inactivate the viral genome by inducing G-to-A mutations. It's a promising breakthrough in antiviral strategies.

Speaker 2: Interesting claim. But isn't this theory still highly speculative? I mean, doesn't it rely on a very specific and controlled environment to work effectively?

Speaker 1: Sure, it's in the early stages. But the biochemical basis is solid. These mutations can lead to a non-functional viral genome, effectively preventing replication.

Speaker 2: But what about the threat of the virus mutating to bypass this mechanism? Viruses are notoriously adaptable. Could we be underestimating their ability to evolve around this?

Speaker 1: That's valid, but every antiviral strategy faces the risk of resistance. The key here is that this method targets a fundamental process in the viral life cycle. It's not just another surface protein we're dealing with.

Speaker 2: And yet, the cost of developing such a targeted therapy could be immense, especially if the virus quickly adapts. Are we really ready to invest heavily in something with such a potential risk?

Speaker 1: I think the potential benefits outweigh the risks. This approach represents a paradigm shift from just treating symptoms to actually inactivating the virus at the genetic level.

Speaker 2: But isn't the scientific community still divided on this? We need consensus before we commit resources. What do the broader studies say about the efficacy of this method across different viral strains?

Speaker 1: True, more research is needed across various viral models. However, initial results are promising enough to justify further exploration. We can’t afford to dismiss a potential game-changer in antiviral therapy.

Speaker 2: I agree we shouldn’t dismiss it outright. But we need to proceed with caution, ensuring that our enthusiasm doesn't outpace the data. Let's map out these uncertainties before making strategic decisions.

Speaker 1: Certainly, a cautious yet proactive approach seems wise. We need to define the disagreement within the scientific community and address these points systematically.
