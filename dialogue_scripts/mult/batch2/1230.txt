**Dr. Adams (Originator):** So, with the emergence of this new data, it's crucial that we revisit the role of the minor G allele of FOXO3. Our findings suggest it significantly downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines.

**Dr. Chen (Interpreter):** That's a bold claim, Dr. Adams. We've been operating under the assumption that FOXO3's impact was minimal. What evidence supports this newfound understanding?

**Dr. Adams:** The recent analysis from our longitudinal study. We observed a marked decrease in cytokine levels in subjects with the G allele. This points to a potential anti-inflammatory effect.

**Dr. Chen:** Interesting. But how does this compare with existing literature? Many studies have shown conflicting results regarding FOXO3's influence.

**Dr. Adams:** True, but those studies didn't separate participants based on their allelic variation. Our approach isolated the variable, allowing us to pinpoint the G allele's specific impact.

**Dr. Chen:** I see. And you believe this warrants a change in our current treatment protocols?

**Dr. Adams:** Absolutely. By targeting this allele, we could develop more personalized anti-inflammatory therapies. It's a game-changer.

**Dr. Chen:** That's a significant shift. If we proceed, it could revolutionize our approach to inflammatory diseases. However, we need consensus from the board before implementing such changes.

**Dr. Adams:** Agreed. I propose we present this data at the upcoming conference. It’s imperative we gain wider scientific approval for this discovery.

**Dr. Chen:** That's a prudent step. Let’s gather our team to prepare a comprehensive presentation. The implications are too promising to overlook.

**Dr. Adams:** Excellent. Let's move forward with that plan. Once we secure the support, we can proceed with clinical trials.

**Dr. Chen:** Then it's settled. We need to ensure that the data stands up to scrutiny. The potential benefits to patient care are worth the effort.

**Dr. Adams:** Indeed, Dr. Chen. Together, we can make a significant impact on the future of treatment protocols.
