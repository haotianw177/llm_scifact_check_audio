**Dr. Lewis (Advocate):** So, Karen, I understand there's some confusion about our recent findings on the progenitors' proliferative capacity.

**Karen (Skeptic):** Yes, Dr. Lewis. You claim that it's regulated cell-autonomously, but there seems to be a contradiction with previous studies emphasizing external signaling factors.

**Dr. Lewis:** I see where the confusion might arise. Our research indicates that while external factors can influence, the core proliferative capacity is inherently self-regulated within the cell. 

**Karen:** But how do you reconcile that with the data showing environmental conditions altering cell behavior?

**Dr. Lewis:** Good question. Our model suggests that progenitors have an intrinsic mechanism that prioritizes internal cues over external ones, unless the external signals are overwhelmingly dominant.

**Karen:** But isn't that a bit contradictory? If external signals can dominate, doesn't that imply they're not fully cell-autonomous?

**Dr. Lewis:** Not exactly. Think of it like a thermostat. It sets the temperature autonomously, but can be overridden if the conditions drastically change.

**Karen:** So you're saying the cell's autonomy is conditional?

**Dr. Lewis:** Exactly. The autonomy functions within a range. Beyond that, external factors can exert influence, but the starting point is always the cell's inherent regulation.

**Karen:** I see. But how do you prove that the starting point is truly autonomous and not just a response to an unseen external stimulus?

**Dr. Lewis:** We've isolated the progenitors in a controlled environment, eliminating known external factors, and observed consistent proliferation patterns, suggesting an internal regulation.

**Karen:** I suppose that makes sense. But what about the broader implications for therapy and treatment? External factors are still significant, right?

**Dr. Lewis:** Absolutely. Recognizing the cell-autonomous aspect helps us understand baseline behaviors, but therapies must consider external influences as well.

**Karen:** Hmm, I see the framework now. But there's still a lot to explore, especially in complex environments.

**Dr. Lewis:** Agreed. This is just the start of a more nuanced understanding. Let's keep the dialogue open as we gather more data.

**Karen:** Definitely. Thank you for clar
