Advocate: Ladies and gentlemen, today I want to bring to your attention a groundbreaking scientific claim. It has been suggested that the removal of reactive oxygen species by activated oncogenes contributes to the increased genomic instability of leukemia cells. This discovery opens up new pathways for treatment.

Skeptic: Thank you for the introduction, but I must say, I find this claim somewhat speculative. Reactive oxygen species, or ROS, are indeed involved in cellular processes, but their role in genomic instability, particularly in leukemia, is not straightforward.

Advocate: That's precisely where the opportunity lies! By understanding how oncogenes, when activated, remove ROS, we could target this mechanism to stabilize the genome, potentially leading to more effective treatments.

Skeptic: But isn't it also possible that this removal process is merely a secondary effect? I mean, ROS are known to cause damage, but cells have evolved complex systems to balance ROS levels. How do we know the genomic instability isn't just an unrelated consequence?

Advocate: It's a valid point, but the evidence suggests otherwise. Studies have shown a direct correlation between oncogene activation, ROS removal, and increased instability. We can't ignore these findings just because they challenge conventional understanding.

Skeptic: Correlation doesn't imply causation, though. We need more than just associative data. What about the role of other cellular processes that might be contributing to this instability?

Advocate: True, but focusing on oncogenes gives us a concrete starting point. Imagine the potential if we could manipulate this mechanism to our advantage. The implications for leukemia treatment are massive.

Skeptic: Yet, without comprehensive evidence, we risk diverting resources from other promising avenues. We must be cautious not to overstate the significance of these findings without further validation.

Advocate: And that's the beauty of scientific debate. By defining these disagreements clearly, we can prioritize research efforts and, ultimately, benefit patients. Let's not close the door on a promising lead prematurely.

Skeptic: Agreed, as long as we remain grounded in evidence-based practices. Let's continue this exploration with an open mind.
