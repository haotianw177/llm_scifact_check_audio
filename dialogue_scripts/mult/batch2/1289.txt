Practitioner: Dr. Lewis, thanks for joining us today. We've come across some intriguing data suggesting a relation between erythromycin use and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in infants. 

Decision-Maker: Yes, Dr. Evans, I've heard mentions of this potential link. But before we proceed, I need to understand the validity of this claim. 

Practitioner: Absolutely. The latest studies point to an increased risk of this gastric condition among infants administered erythromycin in the first two weeks of life. The statistics show a noticeable correlation.

Decision-Maker: I see. But correlation does not imply causation, correct? Could there be other contributing factors at play here?

Practitioner: Certainly, there could be confounding variables. However, the consistency in findings across multiple studies strengthens the argument for a potential causal link. 

Decision-Maker: Have these studies controlled for variables such as prematurity or genetic predispositions that might also influence pyloric stenosis development?

Practitioner: Yes, the more comprehensive studies have accounted for these factors. They still observe a significant association, which suggests the need for further investigation into erythromycin's role.

Decision-Maker: Interesting. If this is indeed a valid concern, what do you propose as our strategic approach moving forward?

Practitioner: I recommend we weigh the risks of erythromycin use against its benefits, especially in non-critical scenarios. Perhaps consider alternative antibiotics when possible, particularly in neonates.

Decision-Maker: Understood. But before we make any policy changes, we must ensure our decisions are evidence-based. Could we initiate a more rigorous in-house study to verify these findings?

Practitioner: That sounds prudent. Conducting a controlled, longitudinal study within our network could provide us with definitive evidence.

Decision-Maker: Very well. Let's proceed with setting up the study parameters. In the meantime, maintain open communication with our pediatrics team to ensure they're informed of these developments.

Practitioner: Agreed. I’ll coordinate with the research department and update you on our progress. Thank you for considering this matter with such diligence.

Decision-Maker: Thank you, Dr. Evans. It’s crucial we balance innovation with safety.
