**Dr. Simmons (Practitioner):** So, Emily, with the new research funding guidelines, there’s pressure to focus on interactions between chromatin remodelers and transcription factors. But, as of now, there's no known interaction between Pioneer factor OCT3/4 and major chromatin remodeling factors.

**Emily (Decision-Maker):** I’ve seen that claim, Dr. Simmons. However, the funding committee believes further investigation is warranted. They’re quite adamant about exploring uncharted territories.

**Dr. Simmons:** I understand the push for innovation, but directing resources towards OCT3/4 without preliminary evidence could be a misallocation. We need to be strategic, especially when the premise lacks empirical support.

**Emily:** True, but isn’t the absence of evidence also an opportunity? If we can establish even a minor interaction, it could be groundbreaking and align with the new policy focus.

**Dr. Simmons:** That’s a fair point. However, there’s a risk of chasing a hypothesis that may not yield results. Consider the foundational studies on OCT3/4; they’ve consistently shown no interaction. Our current understanding of its role in pluripotency doesn’t suggest otherwise.

**Emily:** But Dr. Simmons, if we bypass this, we might miss a pivotal discovery. The mandate is clear about exploring these potential interactions. The committee is looking for projects that could redefine current paradigms.

**Dr. Simmons:** I appreciate the committee's vision, Emily, but scientific integrity should guide us. If we shift focus on mere speculation, it could undermine our credibility. We need a balance between innovation and evidence-based research.

**Emily:** I hear you. How about this? Let’s propose a preliminary study to assess potential interactions. Small scale, low risk, but it positions us well within the new guidelines. If nothing emerges, we can redirect funds accordingly.

**Dr. Simmons:** That sounds reasonable. A pilot study could indeed offer insights without overcommitting resources. Let's draft a proposal that reflects both scientific rigor and exploratory potential.

**Emily:** Perfect. Let’s ensure our approach satisfies both the mandate and our commitment to sound science. 

**Dr. Simmons:** Agreed. I'll start outlining the proposal today.
