 Scientific claim: There is no relation between Erythromycin use and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. 
 Participant Dynamics: Advocate vs. Skeptic 
 Contextual Arena: The Deliberative Arena (goal: to make a strategic choice) 
 Interaction Trigger: An External Mandate (a new law, policy, or trend) 
 Dialogue Objective: To Reach a Decision (choose or reject an action) 
```
Advocate: Given the recent policy push from the health department, we need to assess this claim about Erythromycin and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.

Skeptic: Right. The mandate’s clear—review and potentially revise our prescribing practices. But do we really need to change anything? The current research doesn’t show a connection.

Advocate: I hear you, but the mandate is based on precaution. They want us to ensure patient safety above all, even if the evidence isn't definitive yet.

Skeptic: But isn’t it a bit premature to act on something unproven? The studies so far—like the ones from the Pediatrics journal—show no significant correlation.

Advocate: True, but the new guidelines emphasize erring on the side of caution. If more research surfaces with different findings, we’d be ahead of the curve by already having adjusted our practices.

Skeptic: I suppose. But we need to think about the implications of changing our prescribing habits. Erythromycin is crucial for certain infections. Restricting it might push us towards less effective treatments.

Advocate: Agreed, but that's why the decision should be strategic. Perhaps we could consider conditional use—prescribe it only when absolutely necessary and monitor the outcomes closely.

Skeptic: That sounds reasonable. But we’ll need to ensure all practitioners are on board and fully understand the reasoning. Miscommunication could lead to under-treatment.

Advocate: Absolutely. We should draft a clear protocol and perhaps even run a workshop to bring everyone up to speed.

Skeptic: Okay. So, we're agreeing to a cautious, conditional approach then? Adjusting our protocol but ensuring the team is well-informed?

Advocate: Yes, let's proceed with that. We’ll draft the protocol and circulate it for feedback before implementation.

Skeptic: Sounds like a plan. I'll start gathering the relevant data to support our approach.

Advocate: Great. Let's meet again next week to finalize the details.
