Dr. Edwards: Right, Dr. Kline, we've received the directive from the regulatory board regarding the new approach. It mandates that we incorporate tonic signaling from the scFv to prevent constitutive stimulation.

Dr. Kline: Yes, I saw the memo. It's quite a shift from our current protocol. Do you believe this is the right move, given our ongoing trials?

Dr. Edwards: The science is sound, but the transition isn't without its challenges. Our trials are showing promising results without tonic signaling. 

Dr. Kline: That's precisely my concern. The trials have been stable, and introducing a new variable could complicate things. 

Dr. Edwards: However, the board's decision is based on robust data. They believe tonic signaling could potentially enhance our outcomes by reducing overstimulation risks.

Dr. Kline: True, but we need to weigh that against the time and resources it will take to reconfigure our existing systems. Plus, there's the risk of unexpected side effects.

Dr. Edwards: And that’s where we come in—to assess whether the potential benefits outweigh these challenges. The directive isn’t optional, but we do have some leeway in how we implement it.

Dr. Kline: So, do we proceed with a pilot study first, or do we integrate it directly into our ongoing trials?

Dr. Edwards: A pilot study seems prudent. It allows us to monitor the effects in a controlled environment before a full-scale rollout. 

Dr. Kline: Agreed. We can gather real-time data and make adjustments as necessary. Shall we draft a proposal for the pilot?

Dr. Edwards: Yes, let's get that underway. We’ll need to present our strategic choice to the board by next week.

Dr. Kline: Understood. I’ll coordinate with the team to prepare the necessary documentation.

Dr. Edwards: Excellent. Let’s ensure our approach is both compliant and scientifically rigorous.

Dr. Kline: Absolutely. I’ll start immediately.
