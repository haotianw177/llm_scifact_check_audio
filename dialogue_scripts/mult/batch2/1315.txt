Dr. Collins: So, Emily, your paper suggests transcription rates in S. cerevisiae range between 7 and 12 kb/min?

Emily: Yes, Dr. Collins. That's the data we've compiled from our recent experiments.

Dr. Collins: Interesting. But there's a potential flaw in your approach. If these rates are accurate, it could undermine the foundational models we've been relying on.

Emily: I'm aware, but our results consistently point to these rates. Ignoring them just to fit existing models might stall progress.

Dr. Collins: True, but have you considered the implications? If your data holds, it could cast doubt on decades of research. 

Emily: That's precisely why I wanted to discuss this with you. To ensure the implications are understood and handled responsibly. 

Dr. Collins: The scientific community will have questions, and skepticism. Are you prepared for that?

Emily: I believe so. But I need your guidance on how to present this without causing unnecessary upheaval.

Dr. Collins: The key is clarity and evidence. Make sure your methodology is airtight. If your findings are robust, it will empower others to explore these new avenues of thought.

Emily: Understood. So, you think I should proceed with publishing?

Dr. Collins: Yes, but proceed with caution. Ensure your data is replicable and your conclusions are well-founded. This could be a significant contribution if managed correctly.

Emily: Thank you, Dr. Collins. Your support means a lot. I want to ensure my work helps advance understanding, not hinder it.

Dr. Collins: Remember, science thrives on challenge and change. If your findings are true, they will eventually find their place. Just be ready for the journey.

Emily: I will. Thanks for helping me see the bigger picture here. I feel more confident about moving forward.
