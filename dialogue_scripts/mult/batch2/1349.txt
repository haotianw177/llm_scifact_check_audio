Speaker 1: So, have you had a chance to review the latest data on PD1 and Satb1 interaction?

Speaker 2: I did, and I was quite surprised. The claim that upregulation of PD1 causes the downmodulation of Satb1 is quite unexpected.

Speaker 1: Exactly. It challenges what we've been working on for months. I mean, Satb1 is crucial for gene regulation in T-cells, and this changes everything.

Speaker 2: I understand your concern. But let's not jump to conclusions. The study was conducted under very specific conditions. We need to see if this holds true in broader contexts.

Speaker 1: True, but if this finding is accurate, it could mean our current project on immune checkpoint inhibitors needs a drastic shift in focus.

Speaker 2: Possibly, but let's not forget the sample size in the recent discovery was relatively small. We need more data before we can redefine our approach.

Speaker 1: I agree on needing more data, but PD1's role in immune response is well-documented. If its upregulation indeed affects Satb1, it could unlock new therapeutic pathways.

Speaker 2: Sure, but we need to remain cautious. I'm concerned that if we pivot too quickly, we might overlook other critical factors. 

Speaker 1: I get that, but the potential implications are too significant to ignore. We should at least start planning further experiments to validate these findings.

Speaker 2: Agreed. But while we do that, let's also continue with our current projects to ensure we're not putting all our eggs in one basket.

Speaker 1: Fair point. It seems we both want to pursue this but through different strategies. How about we draft a proposal for a parallel study?

Speaker 2: That sounds reasonable. Let's map out the discrepancies and potential overlaps. We could present this to the team next week.

Speaker 1: Perfect. I think we're on the same page now—moving forward with caution but also embracing the potential of this discovery.

Speaker 2: Exactly. We’ll approach this with open minds but grounded in evidence.
