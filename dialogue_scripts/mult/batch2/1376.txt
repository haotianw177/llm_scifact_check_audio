Dr. Hanson: Good afternoon, everyone. Today's discussion revolves around a recent claim that whole brain radiotherapy might actually increase the occurrence of new brain metastases. Dr. Lewis, you've been working closely with this data?

Dr. Lewis: Good afternoon, Dr. Hanson. Yes, indeed. We've observed some unexpected patterns in our latest study. 

Dr. Hanson: Fascinating. For years, we've trusted whole brain radiotherapy to mitigate metastasis. What could be the cause of this increase?

Dr. Lewis: Well, the hypothesis is that while it targets existing lesions, radiotherapy might inadvertently create a more conducive environment for new metastases. 

Dr. Hanson: That’s quite a revelation. But how robust is this data?

Dr. Lewis: We have a sizable sample group and statistical significance. But like any discovery, it demands further scrutiny and peer review. 

Dr. Hanson: Of course. Has there been any pushback from the community?

Dr. Lewis: Naturally, some are skeptical, citing the long-standing efficacy of radiotherapy. However, others see it as an opportunity to refine our approaches.

Dr. Hanson: And what do you see, Dr. Lewis?

Dr. Lewis: I see a chance to advance our methods. If this claim holds, we could potentially adjust treatment protocols to minimize such risks.

Dr. Hanson: An admirable pursuit. But can you assure patients that this is a step forward?

Dr. Lewis: While certainty is elusive in science, our goal is to ensure treatments are both effective and safe. We owe it to our patients to explore every possibility.

Dr. Hanson: Agreed. It seems we’re at the cusp of a pivotal change. Thank you, Dr. Lewis, for shedding light on this.

Dr. Lewis: Thank you, Dr. Hanson. I hope our findings can contribute positively to future treatments.
