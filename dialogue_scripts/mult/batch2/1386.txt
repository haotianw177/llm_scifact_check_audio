Dr. Emily: So, Jonathan, the study you published claims that cSMAC formation represses weak ligand signalling. That's quite a statement.

Jonathan: Yes, Emily, and it’s backed by substantial data. The cSMAC acts as a filter, if you will, diminishing weaker signals to prevent noise.

Dr. Emily: But isn’t there a risk in ignoring those weaker signals? They could be crucial in certain contexts, right?

Jonathan: True, but the threat of overactivation and autoimmune responses is far greater. We need a mechanism to ensure stability.

Dr. Emily: I see your point, but we've had cases where those weak signals indicated early stages of disease. Suppressing them could delay diagnosis.

Jonathan: I'm not dismissing those cases. However, in the majority, controlling noise is beneficial. It’s about balance.

Dr. Emily: Balance, yes, but at what cost? If our focus is too narrow, we might miss the bigger picture. You’re potentially redefining how we understand immune signalling.

Jonathan: That’s why further investigation is crucial. We can’t ignore the data just because it disrupts existing paradigms.

Dr. Emily: Disrupting paradigms is fine, Jonathan, but what about patient safety? Implementing this in clinical practice could have unforeseen consequences.

Jonathan: Which is why this is still theoretical. We can't make leaps without more evidence. But it’s a direction worth exploring.

Dr. Emily: I agree exploration is needed, but we must tread carefully. Patients’ lives are at stake, and we can’t afford to be reckless.

Jonathan: Absolutely. Let’s map out the areas of concern together and address them in our next research phase.

Dr. Emily: Agreed. We need to define the boundaries of disagreement so we can navigate this responsibly.

Jonathan: Then let’s get to it. We owe it to the science and the patients we serve.

Dr. Emily: Indeed, Jonathan. Indeed.
