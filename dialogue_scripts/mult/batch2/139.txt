Dr. Elara: So, let's dive into this recent discovery. The data suggests that at least 85% of patients exposed to radiation have activated markers of myofibroblasts.

Dr. Khan: Yes, that's what the report indicates. It's quite significant. 

Dr. Elara: Indeed. But, Dr. Khan, can we be confident in these findings? I mean, such a high percentage implies a strong correlation.

Dr. Khan: Certainly, Elara. The study was conducted with a robust sample size and controlled variables. However, it's crucial we understand what this activation means for patient outcomes.

Dr. Elara: Right. The presence of myofibroblasts could indicate potential fibrosis, correct?

Dr. Khan: Exactly. But before we jump to conclusions, we should consider the implications for treatment protocols. 

Dr. Elara: True. If this activation leads to fibrotic development, we might need to rethink our current post-radiation therapies.

Dr. Khan: And that's precisely why we need to align our understanding. The data is compelling, but we need to strategize on how to integrate this into clinical practice.

Dr. Elara: Do you propose we conduct further trials to validate these findings, or should we begin adjusting our treatment guidelines now?

Dr. Khan: I suggest a phased approach. Start with a pilot program incorporating this data, while simultaneously setting up larger trials. 

Dr. Elara: That sounds reasonable. It allows us to be both proactive and cautious. 

Dr. Khan: Exactly. By aligning our efforts, we ensure patient safety while exploring these new avenues. 

Dr. Elara: Agreed. Let’s prepare a proposal for the upcoming board meeting. We need their support to move forward.

Dr. Khan: I'll get started on the draft. Let’s make sure our approach is as thorough as our analysis.

Dr. Elara: Perfect. We need to be both thorough and innovative.
