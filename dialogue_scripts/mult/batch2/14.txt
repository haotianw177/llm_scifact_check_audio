Dr. Mitchell: So, Dr. Reynolds, I wanted to discuss the recent findings on 5'-nucleotidase and its role in metabolizing 6MP. It seems there's some serious implications for our current treatment protocols.

Dr. Reynolds: Absolutely, Dr. Mitchell. But I'm still not entirely convinced. The idea that 5'-nucleotidase is significantly affecting the metabolism of 6MP seems a bit speculative, don't you think?

Dr. Mitchell: Well, the study showed a clear metabolic pathway. If 5'-nucleotidase is indeed altering 6MP metabolism, it could explain the variability in patient response to treatment.

Dr. Reynolds: But isn't the evidence a bit thin? I mean, one study isn't enough to overhaul our entire understanding or treatment regimen.

Dr. Mitchell: True, but consider the potential risk. If we overlook this, we might continue administering doses that are either subtherapeutic or toxic for certain patients. That's a threat to their safety.

Dr. Reynolds: I see your point. However, we've been using 6MP for years with consistent results. Introducing a variable like 5'-nucleotidase without rigorous validation could lead to unnecessary confusion.

Dr. Mitchell: I agree that more research is needed. But ignoring a potential metabolic pathway could also be risky. Shouldn't we, at the very least, consider further investigation?

Dr. Reynolds: I'm not against further exploration, but I suggest a balanced approach. We could integrate this hypothesis into ongoing trials without prematurely changing our protocols.

Dr. Mitchell: That's fair. We should ensure we're not making hasty decisions. But we must also remain open to the possibility that 5'-nucleotidase could impact 6MP efficacy significantly.

Dr. Reynolds: Agreed. Let's bring this up at the next review meeting and see if we can allocate some resources for further study. We're both on the same page about patient safety.

Dr. Mitchell: Excellent. Ensuring we have the full picture is crucial. Thanks for discussing this with me, Dr. Reynolds.

Dr. Reynolds: Always a pleasure, Dr. Mitchell. Let's keep each other informed as new data comes in.
