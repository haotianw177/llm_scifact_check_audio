Speaker 1: So, with the new mandate from the health department, we're required to assess qSOFA scores for all emergency department patients. 

Speaker 2: Right, I saw that memo. They're saying it's linked to how long patients stay in the ED. What do you make of that?

Speaker 1: Well, the idea is that qSOFA can help predict outcomes like length of stay, but I'm not entirely convinced it's a one-size-fits-all measure.

Speaker 2: I agree. While it might be useful, can't it oversimplify patient care? I mean, sepsis isn't the only reason a patient could stay longer.

Speaker 1: Exactly. And then there's the variability in how clinicians might interpret the scores. It's not as straightforward as they're suggesting.

Speaker 2: True. But the policy is in place now. Do we implement it as is, or do we push for a more nuanced approach?

Speaker 1: Maybe we start by integrating qSOFA into our current assessments, but also track how it correlates with actual outcomes here. Gather our own data.

Speaker 2: That sounds reasonable. We could pilot it for a few months, then present our findings. If it improves outcomes, great; if not, we have evidence to propose adjustments.

Speaker 1: Agreed. And in the meantime, we should offer training sessions so everyone understands how to use qSOFA effectively.

Speaker 2: Good point. Let's draft a plan for the pilot and set up a meeting with the team to discuss. We need buy-in from everyone.

Speaker 1: I'll handle the training outline. Can you coordinate with the data team for tracking?

Speaker 2: Absolutely. Let's aim to have something concrete by next week.

Speaker 1: Perfect. With a solid approach, we can make sure this mandate actually benefits our patients.

Speaker 2: Here's hoping. Let's get to it.
