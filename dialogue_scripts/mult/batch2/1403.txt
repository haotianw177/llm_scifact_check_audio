Dr. Carter: So, the new regulation mandates a review of all our siRNA protocols linked to tumor studies. Have you seen the latest data on A20 knockdown?

Dr. Evans: Yeah, the siRNA knockdown of A20. It's intriguing. But the data suggesting it accelerates tumor progression in the murine xenograft model is a bit concerning.

Dr. Carter: Definitely. But isn’t it odd? We’ve been operating under the assumption that silencing A20 could suppress tumor growth. This flips that idea.

Dr. Evans: True. But could it be context-specific? Perhaps the in vivo environment triggers compensatory mechanisms that we’re missing in vitro.

Dr. Carter: I was thinking the same. Could it be the immune response in the mice? Maybe A20 is playing a protective role we're not fully understanding.

Dr. Evans: Possibly. We need to map out these pathways more clearly. But the new mandate pushes us to reassess everything quickly. How do we proceed?

Dr. Carter: We should start by defining the parameters of our disagreement. Is it the model, the interpretation, or something else entirely?

Dr. Evans: The model could be a factor. But I’m more skeptical about the interpretation. The data might be pointing to an indirect effect rather than a direct causation.

Dr. Carter: Right. If we’re focusing on indirect pathways, maybe an alternative approach like CRISPR could provide more insights without the knockdown artifacts.

Dr. Evans: Agreed. We should also consider the impact of tumor microenvironment differences between species. It might explain the acceleration anomaly.

Dr. Carter: Good point. So, let's broaden our scope, include diverse models, and rethink the mechanistic pathways. We need a solid plan to address this mandate.

Dr. Evans: Absolutely. This could be a chance to refine our approach and uncover deeper insights into A20’s role. Let’s draft a proposal for the team meeting.

Dr. Carter: Sounds like a plan. Let’s get to it then.
