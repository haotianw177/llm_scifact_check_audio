Dr. Patel: So, Dr. Monroe, you’ve seen our latest data, right? The siRNA knockdown of A20 in the murine xenograft model? 

Dr. Monroe: Yes, I've glanced at it. You’re suggesting it slows tumor progression?

Dr. Patel: Precisely. We observed a significant reduction in tumor growth rate. It’s promising.

Dr. Monroe: Interesting. But to be clear, we're talking about in vivo results here? 

Dr. Patel: Correct, in vivo. The murine xenograft model showed slower progression when A20 was knocked down.

Dr. Monroe: And how did you measure tumor progression, exactly?

Dr. Patel: We tracked tumor volume over time using calipers and confirmed with imaging techniques.

Dr. Monroe: Imaging is good for validation. So, what's the opportunity here? Clinical application?

Dr. Patel: That's the goal. If we can replicate these results consistently, it could lead to new therapeutic strategies.

Dr. Monroe: But siRNA has its challenges. Delivery and stability, for instance.

Dr. Patel: True, but we’re exploring nanoparticle delivery systems to enhance stability and targeting.

Dr. Monroe: Nanoparticles could indeed improve delivery. How specific is the knockdown of A20? 

Dr. Patel: It’s quite specific, with minimal off-target effects. We’ve conducted thorough profiling.

Dr. Monroe: That's reassuring. So, you’re suggesting a broader study next?

Dr. Patel: Exactly. We’re aiming to expand the study to different tumor types and eventually move towards clinical trials.

Dr. Monroe: Well, if you can align these findings with clinical outcomes, it could be groundbreaking.

Dr. Patel: That’s the hope, Dr. Monroe. We just need to ensure the data holds up under scrutiny.

Dr. Monroe: Count me in for the next phase. I’d like to see where this leads.

Dr. Patel: Excellent. Let’s align our efforts and make this a reality.
