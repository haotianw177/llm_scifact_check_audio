Dr. Reynolds: So, as you know, recent studies suggest that autologous transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells offers better graft function than induction therapy with anti-interleukin-2 receptor antibodies.

Dr. Carter: Yes, I’ve read those studies. But the new hospital policy mandates induction therapy as the primary treatment. 

Dr. Reynolds: That’s what I wanted to discuss. The policy is based on older data. If we could align on this, we might advocate for updating the hospital's protocol.

Dr. Carter: I understand, but the policy is driven by cost-effectiveness and established safety profiles. The stem cell approach is promising but still classified as experimental in our setting.

Dr. Reynolds: True, but the latest data shows significant improvements in patient outcomes. We owe it to our patients to consider the best scientific evidence available.

Dr. Carter: Agreed, but we also need to ensure we’re not jumping the gun on treatments that aren’t universally validated. The board is concerned about liability.

Dr. Reynolds: Perhaps we could propose a pilot study, limited in scope, to monitor outcomes closely. That way, we can gather more evidence specific to our patient population.

Dr. Carter: A pilot study could be a reasonable compromise. We'd need to ensure rigorous oversight, though. 

Dr. Reynolds: Of course. We could involve the ethics committee and keep transparent records of all outcomes.

Dr. Carter: I’ll need to see a detailed proposal, but I think it’s worth discussing with the board. We should aim for next month’s meeting.

Dr. Reynolds: Perfect. I’ll draft the proposal and circulate it for feedback. Let’s aim to align on this for the benefit of our patients.

Dr. Carter: Agreed. Let’s ensure our approach is both scientifically sound and ethically responsible. I look forward to seeing your draft.

Dr. Reynolds: Thank you, Dr. Carter. I appreciate your openness to exploring this together.
