Dr. Lawson: So, Dr. Patel, I've been reviewing your findings on B3-Galectin and its impact on cell resistance to TKIs. It's quite a claim that it engages the alternate KRAS-RalB signaling complex downstream of EGFR.

Dr. Patel: Yes, Dr. Lawson. It's an intriguing discovery, isn't it? By targeting B3-Galectin, we might enhance the efficacy of TKIs in resistant cancer cells.

Dr. Lawson: Fascinating. But I'm curious, what makes you certain that B3-Galectin is the key player here?

Dr. Patel: Our data shows a significant decrease in cell resistance when B3-Galectin is inhibited. This suggests it plays a crucial role in the signaling pathway. Have you seen the altered signaling dynamics in our models?

Dr. Lawson: I have. The engagement of the KRAS-RalB complex is unexpected. But how do we ensure that targeting B3-Galectin won't disrupt other critical cellular processes?

Dr. Patel: That's a valid concern. We're conducting further tests to delineate its specific interactions. The goal is to selectively target the cancerous cells without affecting normal cellular functions.

Dr. Lawson: And what about the potential therapeutic applications? How soon do you think we can translate this into clinical trials?

Dr. Patel: If the next phase of our research confirms these findings, we could be looking at preliminary trials within a year. The opportunity to improve TKI efficacy is within reach.

Dr. Lawson: That's promising. Aligning our efforts to move this forward quickly yet cautiously will be key. We need to ensure all safety protocols are met.

Dr. Patel: Absolutely, Dr. Lawson. With your expertise and support from the institute, I'm confident we can achieve that alignment.

Dr. Lawson: Let's arrange a meeting with the team to strategize our next steps. This could be a significant breakthrough.

Dr. Patel: Agreed. I'll prepare the data and outline our current progress for the team discussion.

Dr. Lawson: Excellent. Let's keep pushing forward, Dr. Patel. We might just be on the brink of something transformative.
