Practitioner: So, Dr. Lee, we’ve been looking into the claim that B3-Galectin increases cell resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors by engaging the alternate KRAS-RalB signaling complex downstream of EGFR. 

Decision-Maker: Yes, I've read about that. It's certainly a promising angle for developing resistance strategies, isn't it?

Practitioner: Well, that's what I initially thought. But as I delved deeper, I encountered some inconsistencies that sparked my curiosity.

Decision-Maker: Inconsistencies? How so?

Practitioner: The claim hinges on the premise that the alternate KRAS-RalB pathway is the primary route for resistance. However, our recent experiments have shown that when we inhibit B3-Galectin, the cells still exhibit resistance to TKIs.

Decision-Maker: Interesting. So you're saying there might be more to the story?

Practitioner: Exactly. It appears that other pathways could be compensating, which means B3-Galectin's role might not be as central as previously thought.

Decision-Maker: That would certainly shift our approach. Have you considered alternative hypotheses?

Practitioner: Yes, we've started exploring the potential involvement of the PI3K pathway. Initial data suggests it might play a more significant role in resistance.

Decision-Maker: That’s a pivotal insight. If validated, it could redirect our research focus and funding.

Practitioner: I agree. However, before we make any drastic changes, I believe a thorough review of all signaling pathways involved is crucial.

Decision-Maker: A cautious approach is wise. Let's convene a team to explore these pathways further. We need to ensure our strategies are based on comprehensive data.

Practitioner: Absolutely. I’ll prepare a detailed report and gather the team. We should aim to clarify B3-Galectin's role and uncover any other significant players in this resistance mechanism.

Decision-Maker: Sounds like a plan. Let’s aim for a meeting next week to discuss your findings and next steps.

Practitioner: I'll have everything ready. Thank you for your support in this.

Decision-Maker: Thank you for bringing this to my attention. Together, we'll get to the bottom of it.
