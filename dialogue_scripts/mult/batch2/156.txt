Practitioner: So, Dr. Collins, the opportunity is right in front of us. Our latest research suggests that BCL-2 promotes the apoptotic effects of c-Myc. This could be a major breakthrough for cancer treatment.

Decision-Maker: Dr. Lin, you know how much weight your word carries here. But how does this discovery differ from earlier findings about BCL-2 as an anti-apoptotic protein?

Practitioner: That's a great question. Traditionally, BCL-2 is known for inhibiting apoptosis. However, in the context of c-Myc overexpression, it seems to paradoxically enhance apoptosis.

Decision-Maker: Interesting. So, are you suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy?

Practitioner: Precisely. By targeting BCL-2 in c-Myc-driven cancers, we could selectively induce cell death in cancer cells. This opens up a new line of treatment possibilities.

Decision-Maker: And what does the data show? Are we sure this isn't just an anomaly?

Practitioner: We've replicated the results across several models. The data is consistent. This isn't a one-off occurrence; it could fundamentally change how we approach certain types of cancer.

Decision-Maker: And what about the risks? We can't afford to overlook potential side effects.

Practitioner: Of course. We're conducting thorough toxicity studies. So far, the results are promising, with limited off-target effects.

Decision-Maker: This could be quite a leap for our oncology department. What do we need to move forward?

Practitioner: We need to initiate a phase I clinical trial. For that, we'll require funding approval and regulatory clearance.

Decision-Maker: If what you're saying holds, this could position us at the forefront of cancer treatment. Let's proceed with preparing a proposal for the board. We need to act swiftly.

Practitioner: Absolutely, Dr. Collins. I'll begin drafting the proposal immediately. Thank you for considering this.

Decision-Maker: Thank you, Dr. Lin. Let's make it happen.
