**Advocate (Dr. Miller):** Good morning, Dr. Johnson. Thanks for meeting with me. I wanted to discuss the recent study suggesting that bariatric surgery increases rates of colorectal cancer. It’s quite concerning.

**Skeptic (Dr. Johnson):** Morning, Dr. Miller. I’ve seen the study, but I’m not convinced. The correlation doesn’t imply causation, you know. 

**Dr. Miller:** True, but the data suggests there's a significant increase in risk. We can’t ignore that. Patients should be aware of potential long-term consequences.

**Dr. Johnson:** But have you considered the confounding variables? Patients undergoing bariatric surgery often have pre-existing conditions that could independently increase cancer risk. 

**Dr. Miller:** Absolutely, but the study adjusted for those factors. The increased risk remained statistically significant. We need to explore this further rather than dismiss it.

**Dr. Johnson:** I agree further investigation is necessary, but I worry about creating unwarranted fear. Bariatric surgery has life-saving benefits for many with morbid obesity.

**Dr. Miller:** I’m not disputing its benefits. However, we should inform patients of all potential risks, even if they're not fully understood yet. Transparency is key.

**Dr. Johnson:** I understand, but we must balance that with evidence-based reassurance. If we emphasize unproven risks, we might discourage patients from undergoing a beneficial procedure.

**Dr. Miller:** Agreed. It’s a delicate balance. Perhaps we need more comprehensive longitudinal studies to clarify these findings. 

**Dr. Johnson:** That’s a step I can support. Let’s collaborate on a proposal. We can aim to define the relationship more clearly, considering all variables.

**Dr. Miller:** Sounds like a plan. It’s important we get this right for our patients' sake.

**Dr. Johnson:** Absolutely. Let’s ensure we’re guided by robust evidence. Thanks for the discussion, Dr. Miller.

**Dr. Miller:** Thank you, Dr. Johnson. Let’s keep the dialogue open as more data comes in.
