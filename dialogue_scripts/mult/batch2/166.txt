Dr. Lewis: Good morning, Sarah. I understand you’re here to discuss the outcomes of your recent bariatric surgery.

Sarah: Yes, Dr. Lewis. I’ve been hearing a lot about how bariatric surgery can lead to negative mental health effects. That’s really concerning to me.

Dr. Lewis: I see. It's important to address these concerns. Can you tell me more about what you've heard?

Sarah: Well, a friend mentioned that people often become depressed after the surgery. But, isn’t the surgery supposed to improve overall well-being?

Dr. Lewis: That’s a common point of confusion. While some individuals may experience mood changes post-surgery, it’s not a universal outcome. There are multiple factors to consider, such as lifestyle changes and personal expectations.

Sarah: I’ve been feeling a bit anxious lately, and I am worried it might be related to the surgery.

Dr. Lewis: It’s possible, but we shouldn't jump to conclusions. Anxiety can stem from the adjustment process and the challenges of adapting to a new lifestyle. How have you been coping with these changes?

Sarah: It’s been tough. I’m still adjusting to my new diet and the way my body feels. Sometimes I just feel overwhelmed.

Dr. Lewis: That’s completely understandable. Adjusting can be challenging, but it doesn’t mean the surgery itself has caused negative mental health outcomes. Have you considered speaking with a therapist who specializes in post-surgical care?

Sarah: I hadn’t thought of that. I just assumed it was a direct effect of the surgery itself.

Dr. Lewis: Therapy can be a valuable tool. It’s about ensuring you have the right support network. The surgery is a significant change, and it’s crucial to address all aspects, including mental health.

Sarah: I appreciate your insight, Dr. Lewis. I’ll look into therapy and see how I can better manage these feelings.

Dr. Lewis: That sounds like a solid plan, Sarah. We’re here to support you every step of the way.

Sarah: Thank you. I feel a bit more at ease now.
