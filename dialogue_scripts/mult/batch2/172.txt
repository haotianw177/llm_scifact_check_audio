Dr. Evans: Let's start with the recent mandate from the health board requiring us to reassess the role of basophils in SLE. 

Dr. Miller: Yes, it's a paradigm shift. The idea that basophils could be promoting disease development is intriguing. 

Dr. Evans: Intriguing, yes, but we need to verify this claim. Our understanding has always been that basophils are largely involved in allergic responses, not autoimmune diseases.

Dr. Miller: True, but recent studies suggest that basophils might be releasing cytokines that exacerbate SLE symptoms. It's a new perspective we can't ignore.

Dr. Evans: Agreed. However, the clinical evidence is still limited. We must explore this without jumping to conclusions. 

Dr. Miller: Absolutely. The mandate aims to align our research efforts. If basophils are indeed a factor, it could open up new avenues for treatment.

Dr. Evans: So, how do we approach this? The board wants actionable insights within six months.

Dr. Miller: Perhaps we begin by reviewing existing literature and then design a study to measure basophil activity in SLE patients. 

Dr. Evans: That’s a solid start. We should also consider collaborating with immunologists who specialize in basophil functions. 

Dr. Miller: Good point. And if we can establish a link, it might even lead to targeted therapies, reducing reliance on broad-spectrum immunosuppressants.

Dr. Evans: That would be a significant advancement. Let's draft a proposal for the board, highlighting both the potential and the limitations of this hypothesis.

Dr. Miller: Agreed. We need to ensure that we're thorough and that our findings are robust enough to guide future policies.

Dr. Evans: Precisely. With a collaborative approach, we should be able to align our efforts effectively. 

Dr. Miller: Let's get to work, then. There’s much to explore, and the clock is ticking.
