Practitioner: So, Dr. Jenkins, most of us have been working under the assumption that TDP-43 interactions with complex I proteins were just a byproduct of neuronal stress. But our recent findings suggest something more groundbreaking.

Decision-Maker: You're referring to the study about ND3 and ND6's role in preventing TDP-43-induced neuronal loss, right?

Practitioner: Exactly. By blocking these interactions, we believe we can significantly reduce neuronal damage. It's a potential game-changer for neurodegenerative diseases.

Decision-Maker: That sounds promising. But how certain are we about these results? We've seen promising theories fall apart before.

Practitioner: True, and skepticism is healthy. However, we've replicated the results across multiple models, both in vitro and in vivo. The consistency is quite compelling.

Decision-Maker: So, what you're saying is that this could potentially open doors for new therapeutic strategies?

Practitioner: Precisely. By targeting the specific protein interactions, we can develop more precise interventions with fewer side effects.

Decision-Maker: And what would you need from me to move forward?

Practitioner: Well, given the significance, I'd propose a dedicated team to delve deeper into this. We could expedite the research timeline and explore potential collaborations for clinical trials.

Decision-Maker: It's a big commitment, both financially and strategically. But if the data is as solid as you say, it could be worth the investment.

Practitioner: I'm confident it is. If we align our efforts, we can be at the forefront of a transformative development in neuroscience.

Decision-Maker: Alright, let’s set up a meeting with the stakeholders. I want to see a detailed proposal on my desk by next week.

Practitioner: Absolutely, Dr. Jenkins. I’ll get started on it right away.

Decision-Maker: Good. Let’s make sure this opportunity doesn't slip through our fingers.
