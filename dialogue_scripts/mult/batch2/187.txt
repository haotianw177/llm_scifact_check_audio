Speaker 1: Now, many of us have grown up assuming that bullying affects all students equally, regardless of gender. But it's time to rethink that. Recent research suggests that British male students may actually experience more bullying than their female counterparts.

Speaker 2: Joining us to discuss this is Dr. Emily Carter, an expert in educational psychology. Good morning, Dr. Carter.

Speaker 1: Good morning, Emily.

Speaker 3: Good morning, thank you for having me.

Speaker 2: So, Dr. Carter, this is quite an unexpected claim. Historically, the focus has often been on female students being bullied. What does the data actually tell us about male students?

Speaker 3: Yes, it's surprising for many. The data is indicating that British male students report higher instances of bullying, particularly physical bullying and cyberbullying. This isn't to say female students aren't affected, but the patterns and types of bullying differ.

Speaker 1: Interesting. So, what factors might contribute to this trend? Why are male students targeted more?

Speaker 3: Several factors could be at play. Social expectations around masculinity might discourage boys from reporting bullying. Additionally, the way bullying manifests—more physical or aggressive—might be more commonly directed at boys.

Speaker 2: So, Emily, how do we empower students and educators to tackle this issue effectively?

Speaker 3: Education and awareness are crucial. Schools need to implement comprehensive anti-bullying programs that address the specific needs of male students. Encouraging open dialogue and creating safe spaces for boys to express their experiences can make a big difference.

Speaker 1: And what about parents? How can they support their children in such situations?

Speaker 3: Parents should foster an environment where children feel comfortable discussing their problems. It's important for parents to actively listen and take any concerns their sons have seriously. This can empower students to seek help and take action against bullying.

Speaker 2: Dr. Carter, thank you for shedding light on this important issue. It's clear there's work to be done, but understanding the dynamics is a crucial first step.

Speaker 3: Thank you for having me. It's a conversation we need to keep having.
