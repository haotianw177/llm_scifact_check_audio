Dr. Lee: So, Mark, you really think that C2 works synergistically with A-769662 to activate dephosphorylated AMPK?

Dr. Mark: Absolutely, Lee. The preliminary results are quite promising. I think it’s a breakthrough in metabolic regulation.

Dr. Lee: I’ve seen the data, but aren't we jumping to conclusions? I mean, synergy between compounds isn't always straightforward.

Dr. Mark: True, but look at how AMPK activity spiked in the assays. It's more than what we'd expect from just additive effects.

Dr. Lee: But have we considered potential confounding variables? The cell lines we used might not replicate in vivo conditions.

Dr. Mark: That's fair, but it’s an opportunity, Lee. If we’re right, this could redefine therapeutic strategies for metabolic disorders.

Dr. Lee: I agree it’s exciting, but we need to be cautious. The last thing we need is another flawed study that gets debunked later.

Dr. Mark: That's why I suggest we collaborate. Your expertise in cellular metabolism could help iron out these issues.

Dr. Lee: Collaborate? Interesting. But, Mark, you know I’m concerned about the reproducibility of these results.

Dr. Mark: And that’s precisely why we need to work together. Your rigorous approach could strengthen the study's credibility.

Dr. Lee: Alright, but we must define the disagreement first. We need to map out what exactly isn’t aligning in our interpretations.

Dr. Mark: Agreed. Let’s schedule a meeting to dissect the data further. We need to pinpoint where our perspectives diverge.

Dr. Lee: Sounds good. If we can resolve our differences, this could indeed be a game-changer. But let’s ensure it stands up to scrutiny first.

Dr. Mark: Always. Let’s make sure we get it right.
