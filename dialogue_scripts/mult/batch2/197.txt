Dr. Harper: Good afternoon, everyone. Let's dive right into today's discussion on immune cell trafficking. Dr. Lee, you've been working on a promising angle, haven't you?

Dr. Lee: Yes, that's right. I've been focusing on the interaction between CCL19 and CCR7. It's quite fascinating.

Dr. Harper: Indeed. The claim is that CCL19 acts as a ligand for CCR7. Could you elaborate on the implications of this for our current project?

Dr. Lee: Certainly. If CCL19 is a ligand for CCR7, it could significantly enhance our understanding of lymphocyte migration, which is crucial for developing targeted therapies.

Dr. Harper: I see. But, is there concrete evidence supporting this claim?

Dr. Lee: Recent studies, including ours, have shown that CCL19 binds to CCR7 with high affinity. This interaction facilitates the recruitment of T-cells to lymphoid tissues, which is pivotal for immune response.

Dr. Harper: That's promising. However, the integration of this data into our framework requires alignment with existing models. How do you propose we bridge this?

Dr. Lee: We could utilize our current model to simulate the effects of CCL19-CCR7 interactions. This would provide a predictive insight into how altering this pathway might impact immune responses.

Dr. Harper: A simulation sounds prudent. But, do we have the resources to carry this out effectively?

Dr. Lee: We do, provided we allocate some from the less promising projects. This could be a turning point for our research, offering potential breakthroughs in autoimmunity and cancer treatments.

Dr. Harper: Aligning our resources for maximum impact is crucial. Let's proceed with a pilot study on this. We'll reconvene next week to discuss preliminary results.

Dr. Lee: Thank you, Dr. Harper. I'll get the team started on this right away. 

Dr. Harper: Excellent. Let's aim to make this opportunity a cornerstone of our research agenda.
