Dr. Evans: Alright, everyone. As we know, the board is concerned about the implications of our recent findings. Specifically, the presence of CCL19 predominantly within dLNs.

Dr. Parker: Predominantly, you say? But isn't that conclusion a bit hasty, given the complexity of lymph node environments?

Dr. Evans: I understand your skepticism, Dr. Parker. However, our data consistently shows elevated levels of CCL19 in these specific nodes across multiple trials.

Dr. Parker: Yet, isn't there a potential for confounding variables? What about the influence of other chemokines or cellular interactions?

Dr. Evans: That's precisely why we controlled for those factors. Our methodology accounted for other chemokines. The threat here is not just academic—misinterpretation could lead to misguided therapeutic strategies.

Dr. Parker: I get that, but the stakes are high. If we're wrong, there could be significant setbacks in our treatment designs. We need to ensure our findings are irrefutable before proceeding.

Dr. Evans: Agreed. That's why we're proposing a collaborative verification with an independent lab. We need to align on this to mitigate any potential risk.

Dr. Parker: Collaboration is wise, but how can we ensure unbiased results?

Dr. Evans: By choosing a lab with no prior involvement in CCL19 research. Their fresh perspective could either corroborate or challenge our findings objectively.

Dr. Parker: That sounds like a reasonable approach. If the data holds up under external scrutiny, I can support our strategic direction.

Dr. Evans: Excellent. The goal here is alignment, Dr. Parker. We both want the best outcome for our research and its application.

Dr. Parker: Indeed. Let's move forward with the external verification and reconvene once we have their analysis.

Dr. Evans: Agreed. Thank you for your diligence. Together, we’ll ensure we make informed, strategic choices.
