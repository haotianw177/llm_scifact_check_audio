Dr. Patel: Thank you for meeting with me, Jenna. I understand you're concerned about the new findings on CD28.

Jenna: Absolutely, Dr. Patel. This research is quite alarming. If CD28 initiates tonic signaling in conventional T cells, leading to an exhaustion phenotype, what does that mean for our clinical trials?

Dr. Patel: It's a valid concern. The exhaustion phenotype could indeed limit the efficiency of our T cell therapies. This is a potential threat we cannot ignore.

Jenna: So, what are our options? Can we still proceed with the trials, or are we looking at a complete overhaul of our strategy?

Dr. Patel: Before making any hasty decisions, let's break this down. The key is understanding the extent of the exhaustion impact. We could either modify our protocol to mitigate CD28's effects or explore alternative co-stimulatory pathways.

Jenna: Alternative pathways? Could you elaborate?

Dr. Patel: Certainly. For instance, targeting molecules like 4-1BB or OX40 might provide the necessary activation without inducing exhaustion. This could empower our cells, maintaining their potency longer.

Jenna: That's an interesting approach. But how soon could we implement such changes?

Dr. Patel: It depends on our resources and collaboration with partners. We need rigorous pre-clinical testing before adjusting the clinical phase. However, taking calculated steps now will inform our direction moving forward.

Jenna: Understood. So, our next step is gathering more data on these alternative pathways?

Dr. Patel: Precisely. I suggest assembling a task force to focus on this. Your leadership in this will be crucial. You'll have the authority to make independent decisions based on emerging data.

Jenna: I appreciate your trust, Dr. Patel. I'll get started on forming a team and reviewing the latest research.

Dr. Patel: Excellent. Remember, Jenna, science is about adapting to new information. You're in a position to turn this challenge into an opportunity.

Jenna: I won't let us down. Thank you for your guidance.

Dr. Patel: Anytime. Let's keep the dialogue open as we move forward.
