Practitioner: So, the latest studies suggest that CRP levels are positively correlated with postoperative mortality following CABG surgery. It's a significant finding.

Decision-Maker: Interesting. But CRP, isn't it just a marker for inflammation? We've known about it for years. What's different now?

Practitioner: True, but the correlation with postoperative outcomes opens up new avenues for patient management. If we can monitor CRP levels more closely, we might predict complications earlier.

Decision-Maker: Predict, yes, but can we prevent? That's the key, isn't it? Predicting alone doesn't justify changing protocols.

Practitioner: Prevention could follow prediction. If we know which patients are at risk, we can tailor their aftercare more precisely.

Decision-Maker: Tailoring care is all well and good, but it sounds resource-intensive. Do we have the capacity for that?

Practitioner: There's an opportunity here for focused research. If we can refine the parameters, it could streamline the process, making it less resource-heavy.

Decision-Maker: But isn't there a risk of false positives? Raising alarms unnecessarily can lead to increased anxiety and additional tests.

Practitioner: That's a valid concern, and it’s part of why we need to define the parameters more clearly. We don't want to overwhelm the system or the patients.

Decision-Maker: Exactly. And there's also the question of cost. How do we balance potential gains against the financial implications?

Practitioner: We need a pilot study. With the right data, we can assess both the clinical and economic impacts. It's about finding that balance.

Decision-Maker: Pilot study sounds reasonable. But we need to ensure it's comprehensive enough to address all these concerns.

Practitioner: Agreed. We’re not looking for a quick fix, but a sustainable solution. This could really enhance patient outcomes if we approach it correctly.

Decision-Maker: Alright, let's explore this further. But we need solid evidence before making any decisions.

Practitioner: Absolutely. We owe it to our patients to make informed choices.
