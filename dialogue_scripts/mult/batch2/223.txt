Dr. Evans: So, Catherine, we've been looking at the data on how cancer cells can actually stimulate the accumulation of intra-tumoural myeloid-derived suppressor cells. 

Dr. Chen: Yes, precisely, by promoting granulocyte colony-stimulating factor production. It's a fascinating mechanism, isn't it?

Dr. Evans: Absolutely. But there's a growing concern—this could mean our current therapies are inadvertently making things worse by encouraging this accumulation. 

Dr. Chen: That's a valid point. If the treatments are stimulating more of these suppressor cells, they could be undermining the immune response we're trying to enhance.

Dr. Evans: Exactly. So here's the dilemma—should we consider altering our treatment protocols, maybe integrate something that specifically targets these suppressor cells?

Dr. Chen: That could be risky. We don't know enough yet about the broader implications of inhibiting these cells. It might lead to unforeseen side effects.

Dr. Evans: True, but if we do nothing, we might be allowing the tumor to bypass our defenses more effectively.

Dr. Chen: We need more data. Perhaps a small-scale trial to see if an additional inhibitor could actually improve patient outcomes without significant negative effects.

Dr. Evans: I agree. A pilot study seems prudent. That way, we can assess any unintended consequences before making a larger-scale change.

Dr. Chen: And we'll need to be transparent with patients about the potential risks and benefits. It's crucial they understand the stakes.

Dr. Evans: Definitely. Informed consent is key. Alright, let's propose this to the board. If they're on board, we can draft a preliminary study design.

Dr. Chen: Sounds like a plan. It's a step forward, albeit a cautious one, but necessary considering the potential threat.

Dr. Evans: Agreed. Let's hope this leads us to more effective treatments. I'll start working on the proposal draft.

Dr. Chen: I’ll gather the latest research to back up our rationale. Let's get this moving.
