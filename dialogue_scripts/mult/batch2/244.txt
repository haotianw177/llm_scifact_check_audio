Speaker 1: So, Dr. Lee, you're suggesting that these hDLE peptides can actually interact with TLRs on macrophages and dendritic cells?

Speaker 2: Yes, precisely. The evidence points to these peptides as potent immunomodulators. They can modulate immune responses by engaging with TLRs.

Speaker 1: That's quite a claim. But isn't there a risk that this could lead to unintended immune activation, potentially causing more harm than good?

Speaker 2: That's a valid concern. However, the studies indicate that these peptides have a regulatory effect rather than an activating one. They help maintain homeostasis rather than provoke an overactive immune response.

Speaker 1: But how can we be sure? Immune systems are notoriously unpredictable. What if this leads to cytokine storms?

Speaker 2: The controlled trials so far have shown promising results with low adverse effects. We need more data, of course, but the initial findings are encouraging.

Speaker 1: Encouraging, yes, but what about long-term studies? Have there been any assessments over extended periods?

Speaker 2: Long-term studies are in the pipeline. The goal is to ensure safety and efficacy over time. However, the immediate findings are robust enough to consider further investment in research.

Speaker 1: And what about the cost? Developing these treatments isn't cheap, and there's always a risk of them not delivering as expected.

Speaker 2: True, but the potential benefits in treating immune-related conditions could outweigh the initial investment. It could lead to breakthroughs in managing chronic diseases with immunological components.

Speaker 1: I suppose the strategic choice here is whether to allocate resources now or wait for more conclusive evidence. It's a gamble either way.

Speaker 2: Precisely. But with the current data, we have a unique opportunity to pioneer a new class of immune therapies. It's a decision to be made with careful consideration, weighing the risks and potential rewards.

Speaker 1: Well, it's certainly something to think about. Thank you for shedding light on this, Dr. Lee.

Speaker 2: My pleasure. Let’s continue to review the data and make informed decisions moving forward.
