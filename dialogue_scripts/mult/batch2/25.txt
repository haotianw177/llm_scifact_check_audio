Practitioner: We've always understood that 90% of sudden infant death syndrome cases occur in infants under six months. It's a staggering statistic.

Decision-Maker: Indeed, but that's why we're here, to dig deeper. What makes those first six months so critical?

Practitioner: Well, it's about vulnerability. Newborns are still developing their autonomic systems. But let's challenge the data—can we be sure the age factor is as significant as it seems?

Decision-Maker: Good point. Could it be that we're simply seeing more cases reported in that age range because parents are particularly vigilant during those early months?

Practitioner: That's possible. But if the claim holds, the risk factors might be more prevalent or pronounced in younger infants. We need to examine environmental factors—sleeping positions, secondhand smoke exposure, even socioeconomic conditions.

Decision-Maker: Right, but let's not overlook that our data collection methods have evolved. Could changes in reporting criteria be skewing these numbers?

Practitioner: Absolutely. Historical underreporting is a concern. If we're comparing datasets over decades, we might be looking at apples and oranges.

Decision-Maker: So, do we need more contemporary studies, then? Ones that account for these variables?

Practitioner: Precisely. We also need to consider genetic predispositions and how they interplay with environmental factors. It's not just one element in isolation.

Decision-Maker: Agreed. This means, while the statistic is alarming, it may not be the full story. We need to advocate for more comprehensive research that includes diverse populations and conditions.

Practitioner: And until then, perhaps we focus on broader awareness campaigns that cover all infants, not just those under six months. 

Decision-Maker: Yes, let's not narrow our lens too soon. More research could expose flaws in the current claim and lead to better prevention strategies overall.

Practitioner: So, let's continue to challenge the data while ensuring we're supporting all infants' safety.

Decision-Maker: Absolutely. Let's make that our next action item.
