Dr. Chang: So, Mr. Li, it's crucial we discuss your test results.

Mr. Li: Sure, Doctor. Is everything alright?

Dr. Chang: Well, there's something important you need to know. We've discovered that you have TT homozygosity in the MTHFR gene.

Mr. Li: TT homozygosity? What does that mean?

Dr. Chang: It means your genetic makeup makes you more susceptible to strokes, especially if your folate levels are low.

Mr. Li: Strokes? That's serious. But I feel fine.

Dr. Chang: Yes, you might feel fine now, but the risk is significant. This recent discovery in genetic research highlights the importance of maintaining adequate folate levels in your diet.

Mr. Li: So, what should I do? Change my diet?

Dr. Chang: Precisely. Incorporating more folate-rich foods, like leafy greens and legumes, or considering folate supplements, could reduce your risk.

Mr. Li: And you're sure this is necessary? I mean, I’ve never had any health problems before.

Dr. Chang: While you haven’t had issues yet, the genetic predisposition is real. It's better to be proactive. 

Mr. Li: I understand. It's just a lot to take in. 

Dr. Chang: I understand it can be overwhelming, but acting now will help protect your health in the long run.

Mr. Li: Okay, Doctor. I trust your advice. I'll start adjusting my diet and consider those supplements.

Dr. Chang: That's a wise decision, Mr. Li. I'll have our nutritionist provide you with a detailed plan.

Mr. Li: Thank you, Dr. Chang. I appreciate your guidance.

Dr. Chang: You're welcome. We're here to support you every step of the way. Let's make sure you stay healthy.
