Dr. Mitchell: Good afternoon, Mr. Lawson. I understand you're concerned about the new prescription guidelines for chloroquine?

Mr. Lawson: Yes, Dr. Mitchell. With this new policy requiring weekly doses, I’m worried about the reports of retinal toxicity. I’ve been on this regimen for almost a year now.

Dr. Mitchell: I see. The research indicates that a 100g dose of chloroquine over a year can indeed lead to retinal issues. But remember, the dosage in these studies was quite high.

Mr. Lawson: Right, but with this external mandate for weekly doses, it feels like I’m at risk. I rely on this medication for my condition, but I can’t afford to lose my sight. 

Dr. Mitchell: Your concern is valid. The mandate is quite broad and doesn’t consider individual factors as well as it should. We could discuss alternative dosages or medications.

Mr. Lawson: Are there safer options that would still be effective?

Dr. Mitchell: We could consider reducing the chloroquine dosage or exploring other prophylactics. Each has its own profile, but I’ll ensure we find the safest option for you.

Mr. Lawson: That sounds reassuring. But is there a risk if I change medications now?

Dr. Mitchell: Transitioning medications always carries some risk, but with careful monitoring, we can minimize it. Your health and safety are my top priorities.

Mr. Lawson: Thank you, Dr. Mitchell. I trust your judgment. Let’s make a decision that balances my condition without endangering my eyesight.

Dr. Mitchell: Absolutely, Mr. Lawson. I’ll review your medical history and we’ll meet again to finalize a safer plan. I’ll ensure that this transition is as smooth as possible.

Mr. Lawson: I appreciate that. Let’s proceed with caution, then.

Dr. Mitchell: Agreed. I’ll see you next week to discuss the best course of action. Take care.

Mr. Lawson: Thank you, Doctor. I feel more confident now.
