**Dr. Patel:** Alright, Emily, I've gone over this lncRNA data several times, and it seems clear to me that cis-acting lncRNAs control the expression of genes near their transcription sites. 

**Emily:** Dr. Patel, I understand that's the prevailing theory, but I'm confused. How does this affect our decision on which genetic pathway to target in the upcoming trial?

**Dr. Patel:** Well, if these lncRNAs are indeed acting in cis, then targeting them could potentially upregulate or downregulate nearby genes. That's significant for our trial's focus.

**Emily:** I see. But how do we determine which genes are actually affected by these lncRNAs? Isn't there a risk of unintended consequences?

**Dr. Patel:** That's the point of the preliminary studies. We need to map out the genomic vicinity and identify potential gene targets. It's a bit of a puzzle, but a necessary one.

**Emily:** So, are you suggesting we allocate additional resources to conduct these studies before the trial?

**Dr. Patel:** Precisely. Without a clear understanding, we could be shooting in the dark. It's high stakes, Emily. We can't afford to miss this.

**Emily:** But time is of the essence, Dr. Patel. The board is expecting results soon. How do we reconcile that with the need for these additional studies?

**Dr. Patel:** We streamline the process. Focus on the most promising lncRNA candidates. It's a balance of precision and speed.

**Emily:** You're right. The potential payoff could redefine our approach. So, we proceed with these targeted studies first, right?

**Dr. Patel:** Yes, but ensure the team understands the urgency. This isn't just about a scientific claim. It's about making informed decisions that could change lives.

**Emily:** Agreed. I'll arrange a meeting with the team to prioritize these studies. Let's make sure we're all aligned.

**Dr. Patel:** Excellent. Let's get to work, then. We owe it to ourselves and those relying on us.
