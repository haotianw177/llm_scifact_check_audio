Speaker 1: So, there's this new policy coming into play that requires us to consider the role of citrullinated proteins in our inflammation research. Quite a shift, wouldn’t you say?

Speaker 2: Indeed. But I’m a bit skeptical about the claim that these proteins can actually disrupt the inflammatory cycle. Seems like a leap.

Speaker 1: I get it. It sounds complex, but it's grounded in recent studies. The idea is that these proteins, when externalized in neutrophil extracellular traps, act indirectly to break that cycle.

Speaker 2: But aren't we just adding another layer of complexity to an already intricate system? How do we know this isn't just noise?

Speaker 1: Good question. The studies show that these proteins modulate the immune response, not by direct action, but by influencing other cellular pathways. It's like a domino effect.

Speaker 2: Okay, but have these effects been consistently observed across different conditions?

Speaker 1: That’s part of the exploration. The initial findings are promising, but yes, it does require more extensive research to confirm these pathways under varied conditions.

Speaker 2: And the policy is pushing us towards this, based on early findings? Feels a bit premature.

Speaker 1: True, but it could lead to breakthroughs in how we understand and treat chronic inflammation. I think it's worth the exploration. The policy aims to motivate us to look at these proteins with fresh eyes.

Speaker 2: I see your point. If we approach it as an exploratory venture, without immediate expectations, it might align with our goals.

Speaker 1: Exactly. It’s not about immediate solutions but expanding our understanding. If we can align on that perspective, we might uncover something groundbreaking.

Speaker 2: Alright, let’s give it a shot, then. I’m on board to explore this further, provided we maintain a critical eye on the data.

Speaker 1: Agreed. Let’s dive into this with an open mind and see where the data leads us.
