**Dr. Mason (Originator):** Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for gathering here today. We have made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of immunology. Our recent study reveals that citrullinated proteins externalized in neutrophil extracellular traps act indirectly to perpetuate the inflammatory cycle via induction of autoantibodies.

**Dr. Patel (Interpreter):** Dr. Mason, this sounds like a significant leap in our understanding. But for the benefit of everyone here, could you clarify how these proteins are perpetuating inflammation?

**Dr. Mason:** Certainly, Dr. Patel. The citrullinated proteins, when externalized, seem to trigger an autoimmune response. This leads the body to produce autoantibodies, which, in turn, sustain inflammation. It’s a vicious cycle we hadn't fully understood until now.

**Dr. Patel:** So, you're suggesting that targeting these proteins could potentially disrupt the cycle and offer a novel therapeutic approach?

**Dr. Mason:** Precisely. If we can intervene at this stage, we might be able to reduce chronic inflammation and provide relief to patients suffering from autoimmune diseases.

**Dr. Patel:** But, Dr. Mason, before we proceed, have these findings been peer-reviewed? How robust is the data supporting this mechanism?

**Dr. Mason:** The data has undergone rigorous analysis and is currently under peer review. Our preliminary results are compelling, but I agree, replication and validation are crucial.

**Dr. Patel:** Given the potential implications, would you recommend immediate action in terms of research funding and resource allocation to further investigate this pathway?

**Dr. Mason:** Yes, I believe this discovery warrants urgent attention. We must prioritize funding to explore therapeutic interventions that could emerge from this understanding.

**Dr. Patel:** Members of the board, you've heard Dr. Mason. This discovery could revolutionize our approach to treating autoimmune diseases. I propose we allocate resources to further this research immediately.

**Audience Member 1:** I second that. The potential benefits are too significant to overlook.

**Audience Member 2:** Agreed. Let's vote to approve the funding.

**Dr. Mason:** Thank you all for your support. Together, we can make a difference in countless lives.
