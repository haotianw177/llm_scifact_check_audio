Dr. Lee: So, Dr. Collins, we've been working under the assumption that clathrin primarily functions in vesicle trafficking, right?

Dr. Collins: Correct. But recent studies suggest it also plays a vital role in stabilizing the spindle fiber apparatus during mitosis.

Dr. Lee: That's a groundbreaking claim. If true, it could reshape our understanding of mitotic stability. But, what's the trigger here?

Dr. Collins: The threat lies in our current drug development. We’re targeting clathrin to inhibit cancer cell proliferation, but if it stabilizes spindle fibers, disrupting it might cause unintended chromosomal missegregation.

Dr. Lee: So, essentially, we’re risking exacerbating the problem we’re trying to solve. That’s a serious concern.

Dr. Collins: Exactly. We need to proceed with caution. These findings need more validation, but we can't ignore them.

Dr. Lee: Agreed. So, how do we inform and empower our team to make an independent decision here?

Dr. Collins: We need to lay out the data clearly. Present the studies showing clathrin's role in spindle fibers, and contrast them with its traditional function.

Dr. Lee: And ensure they understand the implications of disrupting clathrin. It's not just about inhibiting cancer growth anymore; it's about maintaining genetic stability.

Dr. Collins: Yes. It's crucial they grasp that before proceeding with any new protocols. Maybe we can organize a workshop to discuss potential impacts and alternative targets.

Dr. Lee: Good idea. We should also encourage open dialogue. If anyone has insights or alternative hypotheses, now's the time to bring them forward.

Dr. Collins: Right. We need every perspective. This is about equipping our team to make informed decisions, not just following a directive.

Dr. Lee: Exactly. Let's get the data together and schedule that workshop. We need to act swiftly, but wisely.

Dr. Collins: I’ll start compiling the research. Thanks for strategizing with me, Dr. Lee.

Dr. Lee: Anytime. Let's make sure our science is as solid as the structures we're studying.
