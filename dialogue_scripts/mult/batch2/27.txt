Dr. Carter: So, Sarah, you've heard about the new study on chloroquine, right?

Dr. Nguyen: Yeah, the one about retinal toxicity after long-term use?

Dr. Carter: Exactly. They claim that a 100g dose weekly for 5-6 years can cause significant retinal damage. Seems like we need to reconsider its long-term use for malaria prevention.

Dr. Nguyen: But isn't that a bit exaggerated? I mean, we've been prescribing chloroquine for decades. If this was such a widespread issue, wouldn't we have seen more cases by now?

Dr. Carter: Possibly, but the study's thorough. They tracked patients over several years. It's hard to dismiss their findings outright.

Dr. Nguyen: True, but let's consider the benefits versus the risks. For people in high-risk malaria zones, the prophylactic use of chloroquine is almost life-saving.

Dr. Carter: I agree. But the study suggests we should look for alternative prophylactics or at least monitor patients for retinal toxicity more closely.

Dr. Nguyen: That's fair. However, what about the study's dosage? Is 100g really typical for chemoprophylaxis?

Dr. Carter: Good point. It's on the higher side, but not unheard of. Some patients metabolize the drug differently, requiring higher doses.

Dr. Nguyen: Still, shouldn't we be cautious about alarming the medical community without concrete evidence of widespread issues?

Dr. Carter: Absolutely. But identifying potential risks is crucial. We owe it to our patients to consider all possibilities.

Dr. Nguyen: Agreed, but let's ensure we're not overreacting. We need more studies before making drastic changes to treatment protocols.

Dr. Carter: So, we focus on further research while monitoring patients more closely?

Dr. Nguyen: Yes, that seems like the prudent approach. Meanwhile, let's keep an eye out for more data.

Dr. Carter: Deal. Knowledge is power, right?

Dr. Nguyen: Absolutely. Let's keep learning.
