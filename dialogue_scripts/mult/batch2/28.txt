Speaker 1: So, the recent findings suggest that a Th2 cell environment could actually impede disease development in SLE patients. It's quite a departure from what we've traditionally understood.

Speaker 2: I've read that, yes. But isn't there a risk that by focusing too much on enhancing Th2 responses, we might suppress necessary immune functions?

Speaker 1: That's the threat, indeed. We can't afford to compromise the immune system's overall functionality. But if we can strategically boost Th2 without dulling other responses, it could be beneficial.

Speaker 2: It's a balancing act, for sure. Have you considered how we might achieve that balance in a clinical setting? The last thing we want is to cause more harm than good.

Speaker 1: Absolutely, and that's why I think a phased approach might work best. Start with controlled environments to observe the effects, then adjust as needed.

Speaker 2: I see your point. We need to gather more empirical data before any widespread application. But we can’t ignore the potential benefits if it indeed impedes SLE progression.

Speaker 1: True, and we should keep an open line with rheumatologists and immunologists to ensure we're not missing any potential pitfalls.

Speaker 2: Agreed. Collaboration is key here. If we align our research strategies, we can minimize risks and maximize patient outcomes.

Speaker 1: So, are we aligned on starting with a controlled trial phase?

Speaker 2: Yes, I think that’s the best course of action. We can reassess as we gather more data. 

Speaker 1: Perfect. Let’s draft a proposal and get some feedback from the team.

Speaker 2: Sounds like a plan. Let's make sure we're thorough so we can navigate this safely.
