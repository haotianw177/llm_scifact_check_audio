**Advocate (Dr. Moore):** Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'd like to present a rather provocative claim: consumption of whole fruits increases the risk of type 2 diabetes.

**Skeptic (Dr. Patel):** Good afternoon, Dr. Moore. That sounds quite counterintuitive. We've long been told that fruits are integral to a healthy diet. Could you explain?

**Dr. Moore:** Of course, Dr. Patel. The argument is that fruits contain high levels of fructose, which, when consumed in large quantities, can lead to insulin resistance over time.

**Dr. Patel:** Interesting. But isn't the fructose in whole fruits different from the fructose found in processed sugars?

**Dr. Moore:** Yes, but the biochemical impact remains significant. The natural sugars in fruits, when consumed excessively, can still lead to metabolic issues.

**Dr. Patel:** Yet, many studies highlight the benefits of fruits due to their fiber and nutrient content, which seems to mitigate these risks.

**Dr. Moore:** True, but the concern is about overconsumption. In our modern diet, it's easy to exceed healthy limits, especially with the availability of fruit juices and smoothies.

**Dr. Patel:** However, don't those studies also suggest that fiber in whole fruits slows sugar absorption, thereby reducing spikes in blood sugar?

**Dr. Moore:** They do, but the risk arises when people consume fruits without moderation, often mistaking 'natural' for 'harmless.'

**Dr. Patel:** I see your point. But isn't it crucial to differentiate between fruit juices and whole fruits in this context?

**Dr. Moore:** Absolutely. The claim primarily concerns the volume and frequency of fruit consumption, not the occasional apple or orange.

**Dr. Patel:** So, perhaps the flaw lies in how people consume fruits, rather than the fruits themselves?

**Dr. Moore:** Precisely. Moderation is key. We must educate people on balanced consumption.

**Dr. Patel:** Agreed. It's about promoting informed choices rather than outright fear.

**Dr. Moore:** Exactly. Thank you for this engaging discussion, Dr. Patel.

**Dr. Patel:** Thank you, Dr. Moore. Always a pleasure
