**Speaker 1**: So, we've got this new public health policy focused on reducing HHV-8 transmission in San Francisco. They're saying it might be driven by urogenital contact among MSM.

**Speaker 2**: Right, the city's really pushing for more research and interventions. But do you think focusing on urogenital contact is the right move?

**Speaker 1**: It's definitely an interesting angle. We know HHV-8 is usually transmitted through saliva, but this could mean we're missing a key aspect of transmission.

**Speaker 2**: True, but I'm wondering if we should divert resources to this when saliva remains the primary route. You know how stretched our funding is.

**Speaker 1**: Absolutely. But if urogenital contact is a significant factor, ignoring it could mean we're not fully addressing the issue. We should at least explore it further, don't you think?

**Speaker 2**: Yeah, but we need evidence to back that up before changing our focus. Maybe a preliminary study to assess the prevalence of urogenital transmission?

**Speaker 1**: That sounds reasonable. A small-scale study could help us determine if it's worth a larger investment. Plus, it aligns with the new policy's requirements to explore all possible transmission routes.

**Speaker 2**: Agreed. We could collaborate with local clinics to collect data. That would give us a clearer picture without a huge expenditure upfront.

**Speaker 1**: Exactly. And if the data supports it, then we can advocate for a broader campaign or intervention.

**Speaker 2**: So, we're in agreement? We propose a preliminary study to the board and see if we can secure some initial funding?

**Speaker 1**: Yes, let's do that. It feels like a balanced approach. We address the policy mandate while staying grounded in evidence-based practice.

**Speaker 2**: Alright, I'll draft a proposal and we can present it next week. Sound good?

**Speaker 1**: Perfect. Let's hope this leads to some meaningful insights.
