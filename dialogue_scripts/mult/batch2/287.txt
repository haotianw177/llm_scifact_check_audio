Dr. Collins: Dr. Evans, I gather you've seen the latest data regarding apoE4 conversion?

Dr. Evans: Yes, quite alarming. The gene editing approach we thought would mitigate apoE4's effects seems to exacerbate the pathology in human iPSC-derived neurons instead.

Dr. Collins: Indeed. We've been operating under the assumption that converting apoE4 to apoE3 was beneficial. This discovery challenges that premise significantly.

Dr. Evans: Precisely. The implications for our ongoing clinical trial are substantial. We need to decide whether to pause or proceed with a modified strategy.

Dr. Collins: The safety of our participants is paramount. However, halting now could set back our timeline by years. 

Dr. Evans: Understood, but continuing without adjustments might lead to worse outcomes. We must weigh the potential risks against the benefits of further investigation.

Dr. Collins: True. Could we consider an alternative approach, perhaps focusing on another mechanism to alleviate apoE4's impact?

Dr. Evans: That's feasible. There's promising data on targeting specific protein interactions rather than the isoform conversion.

Dr. Collins: A shift in focus could be strategic. We need a consensus from the board, but time is of the essence.

Dr. Evans: Agreed. I'll prepare a detailed report on the new data and proposed alternatives. We should convene a meeting with the board at the earliest opportunity.

Dr. Collins: Let's aim for tomorrow. We need a thorough discussion to explore all angles before making a final decision.

Dr. Evans: I'll expedite the report. We owe it to our participants to ensure the utmost diligence in our approach.

Dr. Collins: Thank you, Dr. Evans. Let's reconvene with the board and determine the best path forward.

Dr. Evans: Absolutely, Dr. Collins. Our next steps must be both scientifically sound and ethically responsible.
