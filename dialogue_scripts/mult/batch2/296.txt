Dr. Chen: Good afternoon, everyone. Today, we're discussing the role of Cyclin A2 in mitosis, particularly its destruction. The core claim is that Cyclin A2 destruction is necessary to switch from unstable to stable kinetochore-microtubule attachments.

Dr. Patel: Interesting. But Dr. Chen, this challenges what we've long believed about the timing of Cyclin A2 degradation. Can you elaborate on how this fits into the current understanding of mitotic progression?

Dr. Chen: Certainly, Dr. Patel. Traditional models suggest Cyclin A2 degradation is less critical until later stages. However, our recent findings indicate that its timely destruction is crucial for stable kt-mt attachments earlier in mitosis. This stability is essential for accurate chromosome segregation.

Dr. Patel: That's a significant shift in perspective. If your findings hold, it could reshape therapeutic strategies, especially in cancer treatments where mitotic errors lead to aneuploidy.

Dr. Chen: Precisely. And that's why I'm proposing a collaborative study with your team. Your expertise in cell imaging could provide the visual evidence needed to support these biochemical findings.

Dr. Patel: An opportunity for collaboration is always welcome. But before we proceed, what are the potential risks if your hypothesis is incorrect? Could it mislead our therapeutic approaches?

Dr. Chen: That's a valid concern. However, by cross-verifying through live-cell imaging and genetic perturbation studies, we can mitigate these risks. Our preliminary data already show promise.

Dr. Patel: Very well. If your data stand up to scrutiny, this could indeed open new therapeutic avenues. I'll convene my team to discuss the logistics of our joint effort.

Dr. Chen: Excellent. Let's aim to set a meeting next week to formalize our collaboration. Together, we can decide the best course of action to advance this research.

Dr. Patel: Agreed. I'll have my assistant coordinate the details. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, Dr. Chen.

Dr. Chen: Thank you, Dr. Patel. I look forward to our work together.
