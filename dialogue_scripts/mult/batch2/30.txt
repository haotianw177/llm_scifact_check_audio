**Advocate (Dr. Emily Carter):** So, Mark, with the new health policy mandating genetic testing before prescribing tamoxifen, I think it's crucial we embrace this. It can significantly influence treatment outcomes for breast cancer patients.

**Skeptic (Mark Thompson):** I understand where you're coming from, Emily, but isn't this a bit premature? I mean, tamoxifen has been effective for decades without these tests.

**Dr. Emily Carter:** True, but recent studies show that a patient's ability to metabolize tamoxifen can affect how well the treatment works. It's about personalization.

**Mark Thompson:** But aren't we jumping the gun here? How many patients are we talking about, really? It seems like a lot of fuss for a small group.

**Dr. Emily Carter:** It might seem that way, but for those affected, it's not small at all. Imagine going through treatment and not getting the full benefit because your body can't process the drug properly.

**Mark Thompson:** I get that, but what about the costs? These tests aren't cheap, and not every patient is going to need them.

**Dr. Emily Carter:** The upfront cost is an investment. In the long run, it could save money by ensuring effective treatment from the start, reducing the need for additional interventions.

**Mark Thompson:** I see your point, but how reliable are these tests? What if they lead us down the wrong path?

**Dr. Emily Carter:** The tests are quite reliable. They're based on well-documented genetic markers. Plus, it's not about replacing clinical judgment but enhancing it.

**Mark Thompson:** All right, let's say I agree. What would implementing this look like?

**Dr. Emily Carter:** We start with a pilot program. Gather data, assess outcomes, and adjust as necessary. It’s about making informed decisions based on evidence.

**Mark Thompson:** Okay, I'm willing to consider it. Let's review the data from the pilot and decide from there.

**Dr. Emily Carter:** Great, Mark. I think you'll see the value once the results come in.
