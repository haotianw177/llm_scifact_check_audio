**Dr. Nguyen:** So, have you seen the latest paper on DMS3 protein? It's claiming that it enables Pol V transcription in vivo.

**Dr. Patel:** Yeah, I just got through it. If this holds true, it could reshape our understanding of transcriptional regulation. But do you think the evidence is strong enough?

**Dr. Nguyen:** The data is intriguing, but I have questions about their methodology. It seems robust, but I wonder if they controlled for all variables. What do you think?

**Dr. Patel:** I agree. Their use of CRISPR to knock out DMS3 was a smart move, but I'd like to see the results replicated in different cell lines. That would solidify the claim for me.

**Dr. Nguyen:** Absolutely. And if we can confirm this, it opens up new avenues for gene expression studies. But, strategically, should we pivot our current project to explore this?

**Dr. Patel:** That’s the big question. If DMS3 is as crucial as this suggests, our ongoing work on transcription factors might benefit from a slight shift. We should consider a pilot study first, don't you think?

**Dr. Nguyen:** A pilot study could definitely provide clarity. We don't want to abandon our current work without solid grounds. Perhaps we could design a quick experiment to test DMS3's role in our existing models.

**Dr. Patel:** Yes, that seems like a balanced approach. We can allocate some resources to this without derailing our timeline. Let's draft a proposal and see if we can get some preliminary results in the next quarter.

**Dr. Nguyen:** Agreed. I'll start drafting the proposal, and we can review it together. It's exciting to think about what we might uncover.

**Dr. Patel:** Indeed. Let's make sure we keep our team in the loop. Their input will be valuable as we move forward.

**Dr. Nguyen:** Definitely. Let’s aim to discuss this in our next lab meeting. I'm optimistic about where this could lead us.

**Dr. Patel:** Sounds like a plan. Let's make it happen.
