Dr. Patel: Good morning, Ms. Lin. I appreciate you meeting with me today.

Ms. Lin: Of course, Dr. Patel. I understand there's a new development regarding the prostate cancer research our foundation is funding?

Dr. Patel: Yes, exactly. There's been a significant scientific claim that's gaining traction. It involves the decrease of p62 in prostate tumor stroma and how it results in defective autophagy.

Ms. Lin: Defective autophagy? Can you explain what that means in layman's terms?

Dr. Patel: Certainly. Autophagy is like a cellular cleanup system. It removes damaged cells and regenerates healthier ones. When p62 decreases in the tumor stroma, this system fails, potentially worsening cancer progression.

Ms. Lin: I see. So, how does this new law or trend affect our research?

Dr. Patel: Recent regulations mandate that any foundational funding must align with cutting-edge scientific claims to maximize treatment efficacy. This means we need to pivot our focus to include this p62 research.

Ms. Lin: That sounds crucial. How can our foundation make informed decisions to support this new direction?

Dr. Patel: First, we need to fund studies that explore p62's role further. I can provide a list of leading researchers who are already investigating this. 

Ms. Lin: And how confident are you that this will yield results?

Dr. Patel: While it's still early, the preliminary data is promising. Understanding p62's mechanism could revolutionize treatment strategies.

Ms. Lin: Alright, Dr. Patel. Let's organize a meeting with the board next week. Your insights will be vital for empowering us to make the best decision.

Dr. Patel: Absolutely, Ms. Lin. I'll prepare a detailed presentation. Thank you for your commitment to advancing our research.

Ms. Lin: Thank you, Dr. Patel. Let's make sure we stay at the forefront of these discoveries.
