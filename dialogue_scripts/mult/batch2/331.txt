Speaker 1: Ladies and gentlemen, today we explore a groundbreaking scientific claim: Deltex interacts with eIF3. Now, some of you might be familiar with eIF3's role in translation initiation, but this is a novel interaction.

Speaker 2: Hold on a second. The claim that Deltex interacts with eIF3 contradicts the established understanding. There's no known interaction between Deltex and eIF3 in the literature.

Speaker 1: Ah, an intriguing point. But scientific discoveries often begin with challenging the status quo. Our team has observed biochemical assays suggesting this interaction.

Speaker 2: Observed? Or assumed? Because, as far as I'm aware, previous studies have consistently shown no such interaction.

Speaker 1: True, but isn't science about pushing boundaries? Our methodology involved co-immunoprecipitation, a well-regarded technique for detecting protein interactions.

Speaker 2: Well-regarded, yes, but not infallible. Artifacts in these experiments can easily lead to misinterpretations. Was there independent verification?

Speaker 1: We're in the process of peer review. However, our preliminary data was robust enough to present to this esteemed audience.

Speaker 2: Robust yet unpublished. Without peer-reviewed data, how can the scientific community accept this claim?

Speaker 1: Peer review takes time, as you know. We are here to inspire further investigation. Sometimes, skepticism can be an ally to truth.

Speaker 2: Indeed, it can. And until this claim is substantiated with replicable evidence, it remains a hypothesis.

Speaker 1: A hypothesis, yes. But let us not forget that today's hypotheses can become tomorrow's breakthroughs.

Speaker 2: Only if they're grounded in reproducible evidence. Until then, let us proceed with caution.

Speaker 1: Caution is wise, but let us also nurture curiosity. I encourage the audience to explore, question, and experiment.

Speaker 2: Agreed. Let the pursuit of truth guide us. Let’s remain vigilant and critical.

Speaker 1: And open to new possibilities.

Speaker 2: As long as those possibilities withstand rigorous scrutiny.
