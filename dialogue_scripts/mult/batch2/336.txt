**Dr. Harris (Authority):** Good afternoon, everyone. We're here to discuss the latest findings on container port throughput and its unexpected link to dengue virus diffusion. Dr. Patel, would you like to start?

**Dr. Patel (Beneficiary):** Thank you, Dr. Harris. Our research shows that increased container port throughput, or CPT, is negatively related to the spread of DENV-1 via air traffic. This suggests that efficient port operations might inadvertently help control the virus's diffusion.

**Dr. Harris:** That's quite intriguing. However, can you clarify how increased CPT could influence viral diffusion in air shipments?

**Dr. Patel:** Certainly. Our hypothesis is that higher CPT indicates better logistical management and faster cargo turnover. This efficiency minimizes the time containers spend in port environments, reducing the potential for mosquito exposure and subsequent virus spread.

**Dr. Harris:** I see. But wouldn't an increase in air traffic potentially heighten the risk of DENV-1 diffusion?

**Dr. Patel:** That's a valid point. However, the data indicates that efficient port operations can act as a mitigating factor. The quicker turnaround might offset the increased traffic's risk because mosquitoes have less time to interact with cargo.

**Dr. Harris:** Interesting. So, you're suggesting ports could become strategic allies in controlling dengue spread?

**Dr. Patel:** Precisely. If we align port operations with public health strategies, we might leverage this efficiency for better control of the virus's spread.

**Dr. Harris:** This sounds promising but implementing such a strategy would require significant coordination between health authorities and port operators. Are you prepared to spearhead this initiative?

**Dr. Patel:** Absolutely. Our team is eager to collaborate with both sectors to develop a practical framework.

**Dr. Harris:** Very well. Let's schedule a follow-up session to explore this strategic alignment further. Thank you, Dr. Patel, for shedding light on this opportunity.

**Dr. Patel:** Thank you, Dr. Harris. I look forward to our continued collaboration.
