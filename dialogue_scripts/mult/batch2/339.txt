Practitioner: Good morning, Dr. Latham. I wanted to discuss the recent study on dexamethasone and its potential to increase postoperative bleeding.

Decision-Maker: Ah, yes, Dr. Kim. I’ve seen the headlines. But aren't we using dexamethasone to reduce inflammation and pain in post-surgical patients?

Practitioner: Absolutely, but the study suggests a significant risk of bleeding, which could outweigh the benefits in certain cases.

Decision-Maker: I find that hard to reconcile. We've been advocating dexamethasone for years due to its established efficacy. What's the specific mechanism they’re proposing for this increased bleeding risk?

Practitioner: The study indicates that dexamethasone might impair platelet function, leading to increased bleeding tendencies, especially in patients already at risk.

Decision-Maker: But isn’t there conflicting evidence? Some research shows no such correlation. How do we decide which evidence to trust?

Practitioner: That's precisely the point of conflict, Dr. Latham. The study sample was large, but it’s the first of its kind, and we should consider it cautiously. More replication is needed to verify these findings.

Decision-Maker: So, you’re suggesting a more tailored approach? Perhaps we identify high-risk patients and adjust their treatment plans accordingly?

Practitioner: Exactly. Until we have more definitive data, we should weigh dexamethasone’s benefits against its potential risks on a case-by-case basis.

Decision-Maker: That sounds reasonable. However, it’s crucial we communicate this nuance to our team effectively. We don’t want to incite unnecessary fear.

Practitioner: Agreed. We should conduct a meeting to discuss these findings and strategize on patient selection criteria. 

Decision-Maker: Let's arrange that. Meanwhile, I’ll review the study in detail to understand the methodologies they used. We need a solid foundation before making any changes.

Practitioner: Perfect. I'll coordinate with the team for a discussion session. Thank you for your openness to exploring this, Dr. Latham.

Decision-Maker: Thank you for bringing it to my attention. Let’s ensure our patients receive the safest and most effective care possible.
