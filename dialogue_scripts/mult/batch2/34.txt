Speaker 1: So, Mary, I've been reading up on this folate deficiency thing, and it seems pretty serious. They say it increases homocysteine levels in the blood.

Speaker 2: Oh, come on, John. You've been down this rabbit hole before. Folate deficiency? Really? How many diets have you tried based on something you read online?

Speaker 1: It's not just some fad, Mary. There's actual science behind it. Elevated homocysteine can lead to cardiovascular issues. That's a real threat, especially given your family history.

Speaker 2: But isn't there always some new study claiming something? How do we even know this one's credible?

Speaker 1: Well, this isn't just any study. It's backed by multiple peer-reviewed papers. They're saying that without enough folate, you can't metabolize homocysteine properly.

Speaker 2: And what do they suggest? That I start popping folate supplements? I don't want to rely on pills for everything.

Speaker 1: Not necessarily pills. We could adjust our diet. More leafy greens, beans, and citrus fruits—they're all high in folate.

Speaker 2: So, you want to overhaul our meals based on this? What if it turns out to be another nutritional myth?

Speaker 1: I get it, Mary. It sounds over the top. But we’re talking about a potential risk to your heart health. Isn’t it worth at least trying for a while?

Speaker 2: Alright, alright. We can try adding more folate-rich foods. But if I start feeling like a rabbit, we'll have to rethink!

Speaker 1: Deal. We’ll make it taste good, I promise. And hey, if it helps, it’s worth it, right?

Speaker 2: Yeah, you're right. Let’s give it a shot. Just don’t expect me to give up my morning coffee!

Speaker 1: Wouldn't dream of it.
