Dr. Hale: Ladies and gentlemen, today we're going to explore a groundbreaking discovery in genetics. Recent studies suggest that distant CREs, or cis-regulatory elements, are vital for transcriptional regulation.

Dr. Morris: Ah, Dr. Hale, always the bearer of exciting news. But dare I say, this sounds like a claim that requires more than just a recent study to validate.

Dr. Hale: I understand your skepticism, Dr. Morris. However, the data shows that these distant CREs, although far from the genes they regulate, have been observed to influence gene expression significantly.

Dr. Morris: Influence, perhaps, but significant? We've known about proximal regulatory elements for decades. I'm curious, how does distance not dilute their impact?

Dr. Hale: Excellent question. The study demonstrates that chromatin loops bring these distant CREs in close proximity to their target genes, facilitating interaction.

Dr. Morris: Chromatin loops, you say? Intriguing, but aren't these loops more hypothetical than proven at this stage? We need more tangible evidence.

Dr. Hale: True, the concept is still developing. However, the use of Hi-C technology in this study offers compelling visual evidence of these loops in action.

Dr. Morris: Visual evidence is a step forward, but isn't it possible that we're seeing correlation, not causation? CREs might be active, but are they truly indispensable?

Dr. Hale: A valid point, Dr. Morris. Yet, when these CREs were selectively disrupted, the gene expression was noticeably altered, suggesting a direct role.

Dr. Morris: Altered, yes, but other factors could be at play. I suppose further research is essential to unravel these complexities.

Dr. Hale: Indeed, research is ongoing. But, if these findings hold, it could revolutionize our understanding of genetic regulation.

Dr. Morris: Let's hope the evidence continues to build. For now, I remain cautiously optimistic.

Dr. Hale: Fair enough. The pursuit of knowledge thrives on healthy skepticism, after all.
