**Dr. Ramirez:** So, Dr. Lee, we've been reviewing your recent findings. You claim EG7 tumors can be killed by systemic oxaliplatin-primed CD8+ T cells from the tumor-draining lymph node cells. Could you elaborate on that?

**Dr. Lee:** Certainly, Dr. Ramirez. Our study shows that by priming CD8+ T cells with oxaliplatin, they become more effective in targeting and destroying EG7 tumor cells. The priming occurs in the tumor-draining lymph nodes, which enhances their cytotoxic activity.

**Dr. Ramirez:** That's intriguing. However, I’m a bit confused about the mechanism. How does oxaliplatin specifically enhance the CD8+ T cells' ability to target these tumors?

**Dr. Lee:** Oxaliplatin acts as an immunogenic cell death inducer. It releases tumor antigens into the lymph nodes, where they are presented to CD8+ T cells. This process essentially 'teaches' the T cells to recognize and attack the tumor cells more efficiently.

**Dr. Ramirez:** I see. But why EG7 tumors specifically? Wouldn't this mechanism apply to other tumor types as well?

**Dr. Lee:** That's a great question. EG7 tumors have certain antigenic profiles that make them particularly responsive to this approach. However, the principles can indeed be extrapolated to other tumors with similar characteristics, pending further research.

**Dr. Ramirez:** So, we could potentially adapt this method for broader oncological applications?

**Dr. Lee:** Yes, exactly. With more studies, we might refine this technique to target a wider array of tumor types. The key is understanding the antigenic makeup of different tumors.

**Dr. Ramirez:** That makes sense now. Thank you for clarifying, Dr. Lee. I think we can proceed with exploring this further for other tumor models.

**Dr. Lee:** Absolutely, Dr. Ramirez. I’m eager to see how this approach can evolve and contribute to more effective cancer therapies.
