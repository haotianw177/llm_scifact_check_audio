Advocate: Now, we’ve all been working under the assumption that HLA alleles were the main genetic component for ankylosing spondylitis. But it turns out, new findings suggest that ERAP1 SNPs are epistatic to these alleles. This is groundbreaking.

Skeptic: Groundbreaking, you say? I need more than just a new claim. How does this fundamentally change our understanding?

Advocate: Well, think of it this way: the interaction between ERAP1 SNPs and HLA alleles means that the presence of these SNPs can actually modify the risk associated with the HLA alleles. It's not just about having the allele anymore.

Skeptic: So you're saying that these SNPs are like genetic modifiers? But how robust is this data? We can’t just overturn years of research overnight.

Advocate: The recent study involved a large cohort and multiple replicative studies. The statistical significance is solid. We’re seeing a clear pattern that wasn’t visible before because we weren't looking at the right interactions.

Skeptic: But if this is true, how do we proceed? Changing the direction of research isn't something we do lightly. 

Advocate: That's exactly why this is urgent. We need to realign our research focus to include these SNPs. This could lead to more targeted therapies and better risk assessment for patients.

Skeptic: I see your point. If we're going to achieve any realignment, it needs to be backed by further collaborative studies. We need to confirm these findings across different populations.

Advocate: Absolutely, and I’m advocating for just that. This isn't about replacing what we know, but augmenting it. We have to act now to set the groundwork for future breakthroughs.

Skeptic: Alright, let's bring this to the larger team. If the data holds, we could be on the cusp of a major shift in our approach.

Advocate: Agreed. Let’s make sure we’re all on the same page moving forward.
