Dr. Lin: Good afternoon, Dr. Patel. I've been reviewing the latest data, and there's something intriguing regarding early PDA screening.

Dr. Patel: Ah, the claim that it increases in-hospital mortality? I've heard murmurs. What have you found?

Dr. Lin: Yes, exactly. A recent study suggests this correlation. The findings are quite detailed, and I think we need to dissect them thoroughly.

Dr. Patel: A correlation, you say? That’s a hefty claim. Let’s explore this. What’s their basis?

Dr. Lin: They analyzed a substantial cohort of preterm infants. The study shows that early screening leads to interventions possibly disrupting the neonates’ stabilization period. Could that be skewing the mortality rates?

Dr. Patel: Interesting. So, they’re suggesting the screening itself or the subsequent interventions are the culprits? 

Dr. Lin: Precisely. The claim is that aggressive interventions post-screening might be unwarranted and harmful. However, I remain skeptical. Could it be confounded by other variables?

Dr. Patel: That's a valid point. Interventions are protocol-based, but they're not one-size-fits-all. What control measures did this study employ?

Dr. Lin: They accounted for gestational age and birth weight, but I’m concerned they might have overlooked the variability in hospital practices.

Dr. Patel: And therein lies a potential flaw. If practices differ, outcomes could, too. Do we have comparative data from institutions with varied protocols?

Dr. Lin: Not in this study. It’s a gap that needs addressing. I propose we examine multi-center datasets. We could uncover whether the claim holds uniformly across different settings.

Dr. Patel: An excellent approach. If we expose inconsistencies, we might redefine early screening protocols. Let’s dive deeper, Dr. Lin. This discovery could reshape neonatal care.

Dr. Lin: Agreed. Let’s arrange a meeting with our colleagues to brainstorm further. We need all perspectives to validate or weaken this claim effectively.
