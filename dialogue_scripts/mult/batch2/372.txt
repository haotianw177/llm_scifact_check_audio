Advocate (Dr. Collins): Good morning, Dr. Lee. I wanted to discuss the recent study on the Eilat virus, or EILV. It seems like it's quite the breakthrough. 

Skeptic (Dr. Lee): Morning, Collins. Yes, I've skimmed it. But you do realize we're talking about a virus produced in mosquitos here. How reliable can those findings really be?

Advocate: Well, the study shows that EILV elicits rapid and long-lasting neutralizing antibodies in nonhuman primates. This could be a significant step forward in vaccine development.

Skeptic: I understand the potential, but we're dealing with nonhuman primates, not humans. There's a vast difference. Remember the Zika virus vaccine trials?

Advocate: True, but the immune response observed was remarkably robust and consistent. This kind of response is promising, don't you think?

Skeptic: Promising, yes, but proof of concept in nonhuman subjects doesn't guarantee transferability to humans. We need more data.

Advocate: Absolutely, more trials are necessary. But isn't it worth considering a small-scale human trial? It might expedite the process.

Skeptic: Not so fast, Collins. We need to ensure the safety profile in primates first. What about potential side effects?

Advocate: The study reported minimal adverse effects. We should weigh the potential benefits against the risks. It could be a game-changer for vector-borne diseases.

Skeptic: I'm not against progress, but we must tread carefully. Hastiness has backfired in the past. 

Advocate: Agreed, caution is key. But we can't ignore the urgent need for new approaches. The faster we reach a decision, the sooner we can address these global health threats.

Skeptic: Let's propose a detailed plan for a phased human trial, with stringent safety checks. That way, we remain cautious yet proactive.

Advocate: That sounds like a reasonable approach. Let's draft that plan and present it to the board. We might just be on the brink of something monumental.

Skeptic: Let's hope so. Science always needs a bit of hope, doesn't it?
