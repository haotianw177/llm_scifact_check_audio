**Advocate:** Good afternoon, everyone. Today, we're here to discuss a crucial issue. The new global health mandate aims to eliminate malaria completely, but it requires significant funding to target those last sporadic cases.

**Skeptic:** Afternoon. Before we dive in, I must say, I’m skeptical about this necessity. We've made substantial progress already. Why pour more money into what's almost eradicated?

**Advocate:** It's a valid question. However, the sporadic cases exist in remote areas, often underserved and vulnerable. Without addressing these, we risk resurgence. Malaria isn’t just a health issue; it’s an economic one, too.

**Skeptic:** But how much are we really talking here? Couldn’t these funds be better allocated to diseases that are more prevalent?

**Advocate:** The cost is significant, yes, but the return on investment is enormous. For every dollar spent, there’s a $36 return in increased productivity and reduced healthcare costs. Moreover, it saves lives. Isn’t that worth the initial outlay?

**Skeptic:** I see your point, but can you guarantee this funding will be used efficiently? We've seen mismanagement before in health sectors.

**Advocate:** Absolutely. This mandate includes strict oversight and transparency measures. Plus, it empowers local communities, creating jobs and infrastructure. It’s about sustainable health systems, not just a quick fix.

**Skeptic:** I appreciate the transparency. However, convincing taxpayers to support this requires more than just numbers. They need to feel the urgency.

**Advocate:** True. That’s why we’re focusing on education and awareness. Once people understand the stakes, they’re more likely to support the cause. It's not just about statistics; it’s about human stories and tangible impact.

**Skeptic:** That’s compelling. I’m still cautious, but I see the potential. Perhaps with more community engagement, we could garner broader support.

**Advocate:** Exactly. With informed and empowered communities, we can make malaria history. Together, we can ensure a healthier future for everyone.

**Skeptic:** I’ll keep an open mind. Thank you for shedding light on this.

**Advocate:** Thank
