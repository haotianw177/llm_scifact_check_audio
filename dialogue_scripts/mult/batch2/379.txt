Dr. Collins: Good afternoon, everyone. We've gathered today to discuss a recent breakthrough in our study of viral infections in the lungs. Our data indicates that enhanced early production of inflammatory chemokines might actually be damaging our ability to control the virus. 

Dr. Green: Fascinating, Dr. Collins. So, you're saying the very response meant to protect us might be sabotaging our efforts?

Dr. Collins: Precisely. Our immune system's early response is hyperactive, and instead of containing the virus, it's causing more inflammation and damage to lung tissue. 

Dr. Rivera: This is quite a shift from our usual understanding. Traditionally, we’ve relied on boosting immune responses. Are you suggesting we need to reconsider our approach entirely?

Dr. Collins: I am. Our findings suggest that moderating this initial chemokine surge could be more beneficial. We must strategically decide if and how we should adjust our treatment protocols.

Dr. Green: That’s a significant paradigm shift. But if we dampen the response too much, don't we risk undercutting the body's ability to fight the infection?

Dr. Collins: Absolutely, Dr. Green. It's a delicate balance. The goal is not to suppress the immune response entirely, but to fine-tune it. We're in uncharted territory, which is why alignment here is crucial.

Dr. Rivera: Agreed. We should consider devising a controlled study to explore this further. Perhaps a phased approach, starting with a small cohort?

Dr. Collins: That's a sound strategy, Dr. Rivera. I propose we assemble a task force to design this study. We need consensus and collaboration moving forward to ensure we don't compromise patient safety.

Dr. Green: I'm on board. This discovery could lead to more effective treatments if we handle it correctly. 

Dr. Rivera: Then let’s get to work. Time is of the essence, and I believe we can all agree on that.

Dr. Collins: Excellent. I'll coordinate our first task force meeting. Thank you all for your commitment to this vital work.
