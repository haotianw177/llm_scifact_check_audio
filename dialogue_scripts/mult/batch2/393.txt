Practitioner: Good morning, Dr. Collins. The new environmental mandate from the regulatory board has sparked quite a debate about ethanol use in our lab experiments.

Decision-Maker: Yes, I’ve seen the reports. They claim ethanol stress reduces the expression of SRL in bacteria. Is that something we should be concerned about?

Practitioner: Well, it’s certainly a noteworthy claim. But, if I may, I believe there’s a flaw in the interpretation of the data.

Decision-Maker: Go on.

Practitioner: The study didn’t account for the variability in bacterial strains. They only tested one type. Ethanol stress might not universally reduce SRL expression across all strains.

Decision-Maker: So, you're suggesting the policy based on this research might be premature?

Practitioner: Precisely. We could risk stalling potentially beneficial experiments if we adhere strictly to this mandate without a broader investigation.

Decision-Maker: But isn’t the regulation in place to prevent any negative impacts from ethanol exposure in our processes?

Practitioner: Absolutely. And safety is paramount. However, a blanket policy based on limited data could stifle innovation. We need to balance precaution with the need for comprehensive evidence.

Decision-Maker: How would you propose we proceed?

Practitioner: I recommend conducting a diversified study across multiple bacterial strains. We could then validate if ethanol stress consistently impacts SRL expression.

Decision-Maker: That sounds reasonable. Would this require significant resources?

Practitioner: It would require some reallocation of resources, but considering the potential impact on our research outcomes, I believe it’s justified.

Decision-Maker: Alright. Let's draft a proposal for this extended study. I’ll present it to the board and see if we can adjust the mandate accordingly.

Practitioner: Thank you, Dr. Collins. I’ll get started on the proposal right away.

Decision-Maker: Thank you. Let’s ensure our decisions are grounded in robust evidence.
