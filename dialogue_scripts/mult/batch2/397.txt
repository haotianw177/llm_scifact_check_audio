Speaker 1: Ladies and gentlemen, today we present a groundbreaking claim: "Exercise reduces cancer mortality rates among Chinese citizens." This recent discovery could change lives.

Speaker 2: Dr. Liu, you authored the study. How definitive are these findings?

Speaker 3: Good morning. Our study followed over 100,000 participants for a decade. We found a strong correlation between regular exercise and reduced cancer mortality. The data is compelling.

Speaker 1: But, Dr. Liu, correlation isn't causation. How can we be sure exercise is the factor, not diet or genetics?

Speaker 3: Absolutely, correlation isn't causation. However, we controlled for diet, smoking, and socioeconomic factors. The exercise variable consistently showed significant impact.

Speaker 2: Dr. Chen, as a skeptic, what’s your take on these results?

Speaker 4: Thank you. While the data is intriguing, my concern lies in the methodology. The reliance on self-reported exercise levels could introduce bias. People may overestimate their activity.

Speaker 3: A valid point, Dr. Chen. However, we cross-referenced self-reports with wearable fitness trackers for a subset of participants. The results aligned, reinforcing our findings.

Speaker 1: Dr. Chen, does this address your concerns?

Speaker 4: Partially. Yet, without randomized control trials, we can't definitively say exercise alone reduces cancer mortality. We must explore causality further.

Speaker 2: Dr. Liu, any plans for such trials?

Speaker 3: Indeed. We’re designing a follow-up randomized control trial to solidify these findings. But our current data is a powerful indicator.

Speaker 1: Dr. Chen, does this give you hope or skepticism?

Speaker 4: Cautious optimism. If future trials confirm this, it could revolutionize cancer prevention strategies in China and beyond.

Speaker 1: Thank you both for your insights. This discovery might indeed pave the way for significant health policy changes worldwide.
