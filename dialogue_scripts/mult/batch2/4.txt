Advocate: So, we've been discussing the treatment avenues for colorectal cancer patients, and it's crucial to address that 1-1% of these patients are diagnosed with regional or distant metastases. This significantly impacts our strategy. 

Skeptic: Wait a minute, did you just say 1-1%? That doesn’t make sense. How can it be 1-1%?

Advocate: Ah, I see the confusion. It’s actually a range; between 1% and 10% of patients are diagnosed with metastases at these stages. It’s a significant portion, which means we need to focus on early detection.

Skeptic: I get the range now, but even then, shouldn't our focus be on the larger percentage that isn't metastatic yet? Isn’t prevention more effective than treatment?

Advocate: Certainly, prevention is key. However, those who are already in the metastatic stage require immediate and tailored interventions. We can’t ignore them because the statistics seem small. Their survival rates and quality of life depend on us making informed choices.

Skeptic: I understand that, but how can we justify allocating resources to such a small percentage when early-stage interventions could potentially help more people?

Advocate: A valid point, but the impact of metastatic disease on patients and their families is profound. By creating specialized programs for them, we can improve outcomes and potentially reduce long-term costs associated with advanced treatments.

Skeptic: Okay, but how do we ensure that this focus doesn’t detract from broader prevention efforts? We need a balanced approach.

Advocate: Absolutely, a dual strategy is essential. We need to enhance early detection while also supporting those already affected by metastases. It's about creating a comprehensive cancer care system.

Skeptic: That makes sense. So, we need to map out how to allocate resources effectively without neglecting any group.

Advocate: Precisely. By defining our priorities clearly, we can strategize effectively to cover all bases without compromising on the quality of care.
