**Dr. Collins:** So, Sarah, I was going through the latest data on BMP4 and MSX2, and it looks like we've got something interesting.

**Dr. Harris:** Really? What did you find?

**Dr. Collins:** The expression of MSX2 gets induced within just 3 hours after adding BMP4. That's earlier than the activation of T and CDX2.

**Dr. Harris:** That's fascinating. Does this mean MSX2 could be a more immediate indicator of BMP4 activity?

**Dr. Collins:** Exactly. If MSX2 responds faster, it might give us a head start in monitoring cellular differentiation processes. Think of the potential applications in regenerative medicine.

**Dr. Harris:** So, you're suggesting that we could harness this earlier response to control stem cell differentiation more precisely?

**Dr. Collins:** Yes, precisely! If we can reliably predict and influence when MSX2 kicks in, we could streamline differentiation pathways and maybe improve outcomes in tissue engineering.

**Dr. Harris:** That's a compelling opportunity. We need to consider how we might integrate this into our current protocol. It could be a game-changer.

**Dr. Collins:** Agreed. But before we rush in, we should validate these findings with further experiments. We need to ensure this isn't an anomaly.

**Dr. Harris:** Of course. We should also think about potential collaborations. This discovery could attract interest from labs focused on similar pathways.

**Dr. Collins:** True. We should reach out to Dr. Liu's team. They've done extensive work on BMP4. They might offer valuable insights or even join forces with us.

**Dr. Harris:** Good idea. Let's prepare a collaborative proposal. If we can leverage their expertise, we might accelerate our research significantly.

**Dr. Collins:** Alright, I'll start drafting something. We need to make sure this opportunity doesn't slip through our fingers.

**Dr. Harris:** Definitely. Let's make this work. This could be a pivotal moment for our research.
