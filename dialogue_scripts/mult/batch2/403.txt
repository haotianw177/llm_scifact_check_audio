Beneficiary: Dr. Monroe, I've just read the new policy from the medical board. They're suggesting that the expression of oncolytic virus antigens as peptides makes relapse more likely. 

Authority: Yes, Dr. Patel, that's correct. The policy has been updated in light of recent studies. 

Beneficiary: But we've been seeing promising results with our current treatment approach. Are we now expected to change everything based on this?

Authority: The board's recommendation comes from a place of caution. The studies indicate a potential risk, and they believe it's prudent to consider alternative strategies.

Beneficiary: I understand the safety concerns, but our data here shows sustained remission rates. Shouldn't we factor in our specific patient outcomes before making a blanket change?

Authority: True, but the external mandate prioritizes broader applicability. Our responsibility is to align with these guidelines unless we can present compelling evidence to the contrary.

Beneficiary: What if we conduct a focused study on our patient cohort? It could provide valuable insights and perhaps allow us to continue our current protocols under special approval.

Authority: That could be a viable approach. However, we'd need to ensure the study is rigorous and swiftly executed to avoid any compliance issues in the interim.

Beneficiary: Agreed. I’ll coordinate with the research team to draft a proposal. Could you assist in liaising with the board for a temporary exemption while we gather the necessary data?

Authority: Certainly. I'll discuss it with the board chair. In the meantime, let's ensure our current patients are informed about the potential changes and our plan to address them.

Beneficiary: Thank you, Dr. Monroe. I appreciate your support. I believe this is the best course for our patients.

Authority: I hope so, Dr. Patel. Let's work together to ensure we reach a decision that benefits everyone involved.
