**Dr. Taylor (Advocate):** Ladies and gentlemen, today we're exploring a groundbreaking advancement in cancer treatment. Imagine a world where the expression of oncolytic virus antigens as peptides provides additional protection against relapse.

**Dr. Reed (Skeptic):** Dr. Taylor, that's quite a claim. But how do we know this isn't just another scientific theory that lacks practical application?

**Dr. Taylor:** Excellent question, Dr. Reed. The opportunity here lies in the data we've collected. Studies have shown that these peptides can stimulate the immune system more effectively, reducing the chances of cancer coming back.

**Dr. Reed:** But what about the potential side effects? The immune system is notoriously unpredictable.

**Dr. Taylor:** True, and that's why our trials have been meticulous. We've observed that the immune response is not only robust but also specifically targeted. This minimizes collateral damage to healthy cells.

**Dr. Reed:** I understand the intention, but convincing the medical community requires more than just data from controlled environments. Real-world scenarios are much messier.

**Dr. Taylor:** Absolutely, and that's why we're collaborating with hospitals for broader clinical trials. The patients involved are showing promising signs of sustained remission.

**Dr. Reed:** Promising, yes, but how do we ensure long-term efficacy? Cancer is notorious for its ability to evolve.

**Dr. Taylor:** That's the beauty of using oncolytic viruses. They evolve alongside the cancer, maintaining the immune system's vigilance. It's like having a constantly updating defense system.

**Dr. Reed:** I see the potential, but I'm still cautious. Can this really empower patients to make informed decisions about their treatment?

**Dr. Taylor:** It can. By understanding how these peptides work, patients can actively participate in their treatment planning, making informed decisions that suit their personal health goals.

**Dr. Reed:** Well, if these trials prove successful, it could indeed open a new chapter in oncology. But I'll be watching the data closely.

**Dr. Taylor:** I wouldn't expect anything less, Dr. Reed. Together, let's ensure this opportunity truly benefits those who need it most.
