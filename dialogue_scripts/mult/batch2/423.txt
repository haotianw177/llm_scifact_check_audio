Dr. Ellington: Good afternoon, everyone. Let's dive right in. We're here to examine the risk factors for preeclampsia. Recent studies suggest folate and vitamin B12 levels might influence the association between homocysteine and preeclampsia. 

Sarah: Hi, Dr. Ellington. Sorry to interrupt, but why are we focusing on folate and B12 specifically? Aren't there other factors we should consider?

Dr. Ellington: That's a valid point, Sarah. However, the correlation between homocysteine levels and preeclampsia is significant. The hypothesis is that folate and B12 deficiencies exacerbate this risk.

Sarah: But doesn't that mean we're potentially overlooking other nutritional or environmental factors? Just relying on these vitamins could be risky.

Dr. Ellington: Indeed, there are multiple factors at play, but prioritizing folate and B12 is a strategic choice based on current evidence. Their role in reducing homocysteine levels is well-documented.

Sarah: I get that, but suppose we direct resources primarily towards these vitamins. Are we prepared for the backlash if the results aren't as expected?

Dr. Ellington: That's the threat we need to address. If we misstep, it could undermine our credibility. But the potential benefits are compelling enough to warrant focused research.

Sarah: So, you're saying we should proceed despite the risk? What if emerging data contradicts our approach?

Dr. Ellington: That's a possibility. However, refining our strategy as new data becomes available is imperative. We must remain adaptable.

Sarah: I still feel we might be putting too many eggs in one basket. Shouldn't we broaden our scope to include other nutrients?

Dr. Ellington: I understand your concern, Sarah. Let's map out these points of disagreement. Our goal is to ensure a balanced approach that addresses all potential risks while still making impactful progress.

Sarah: Agreed. As long as we're open to revisiting our strategy, I'm on board. 

Dr. Ellington: Excellent. Let's define our strategy clearly, with contingencies in place for any emerging evidence. Meeting adjourned.
