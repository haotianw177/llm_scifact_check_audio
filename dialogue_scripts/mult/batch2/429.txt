Speaker 1: So, the recent directive from the scientific advisory board mandates that we address the competition between N-terminal pyroglutamate formation by glutamine cyclase and NTAQ1 for Nt-Gln substrates.

Speaker 2: Right, a fascinating development. But we need to decide whether we're going to support further research into this area or focus on other priorities.

Speaker 1: Exactly. The directive suggests that this competition could have significant implications for protein degradation pathways. 

Speaker 2: But isn't this just one of many such biochemical interactions? Why should this take precedence over others?

Speaker 1: Well, consider the potential therapeutic applications. If we understand how GC and NTAQ1 compete, we could develop targeted treatments for diseases linked to protein misfolding.

Speaker 2: That's true, but our resources are limited. We need to be strategic. What makes you believe this is the most pressing issue?

Speaker 1: The preliminary data is compelling. The modulation of GC activity could lead to breakthroughs in neurodegenerative diseases.

Speaker 2: But is there enough evidence to prioritize this over, say, ongoing cancer research?

Speaker 1: If we can establish a clear link between GC activity and disease progression, it might even open new avenues in oncology.

Speaker 2: I see your point. Engaging with this could potentially yield significant cross-disciplinary benefits.

Speaker 1: Precisely. This isn't just about one pathway. It's about enhancing our understanding of cellular processes as a whole.

Speaker 2: Alright, I’m convinced. Let’s propose a pilot study. If the initial results are promising, we can secure more funding.

Speaker 1: Agreed. I’ll draft a proposal for the board. Hopefully, we can align our timelines with the new directive.

Speaker 2: Sounds like a plan. Let’s ensure our approach is robust and well-supported by the data.

Speaker 1: Absolutely. This could be a pivotal moment for our research.

Speaker 2: Indeed. Let's get to work.
