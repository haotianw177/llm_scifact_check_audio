**Dr. Simmons:** Good morning, Amelia. Please, take a seat.

**Amelia:** Morning, Dr. Simmons. Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

**Dr. Simmons:** Of course. I understand you received the recent health advisory about HNF4A mutations?

**Amelia:** Yes, I did. It was... overwhelming. They said it could lead to diabetes by age 14. My daughter, Lila, just turned 13.

**Dr. Simmons:** I can imagine how concerning that must be. The new healthcare mandate requires us to inform families about genetic findings and offer guidance. Let’s discuss what this could mean for Lila.

**Amelia:** Is there anything we can do to prevent it?

**Dr. Simmons:** While we can't change genetics, we can manage risk factors. A balanced diet, regular exercise, and monitoring blood sugar levels can help. It’s about being proactive.

**Amelia:** So, it’s not a guaranteed diagnosis?

**Dr. Simmons:** Correct. The mutation increases risk, but it doesn’t guarantee diabetes. We’re here to empower you with the right tools and knowledge.

**Amelia:** That’s a relief. But how do we start this process for Lila?

**Dr. Simmons:** We’ll begin with a baseline blood test to monitor her glucose levels. I’ll also connect you with a nutritionist who specializes in pediatric care. They’ll help create a plan tailored for Lila.

**Amelia:** That sounds helpful. I just want to make sure we’re doing everything possible.

**Dr. Simmons:** You’re doing exactly what you need to do, Amelia. Staying informed and involved is key. We’ll work together to ensure Lila stays healthy.

**Amelia:** Thank you, Dr. Simmons. I feel more at ease knowing we have a plan.

**Dr. Simmons:** My pleasure. We’ll schedule follow-ups and keep you informed every step of the way. Remember, you’re not alone in this.

**Amelia:** That’s comforting to hear. Thanks again.

**Dr. Simmons:** Anytime, Amelia. We’re here to support you and Lila.
