Dr. Grant: Alright, Dr. Collins, we need to address the elephant in the lab. There's a growing concern about genome stability and its link to pre-mRNA splicing genes.

Dr. Collins: Indeed, Dr. Grant. The claim is that these genes are pivotal. But what exactly is the threat here?

Dr. Grant: The threat is real, Dr. Collins. If these genes are compromised, it could lead to increased genome instability, which might result in an array of genetic disorders or even cancer. 

Dr. Collins: That's quite alarming. But how do we quantify this impact? Is there substantial evidence to support this claim?

Dr. Grant: Absolutely. Recent studies have shown that mutations in splicing factors can disrupt the delicate balance of genome maintenance mechanisms. It's like a domino effect – one misstep, and the whole system is at risk.

Dr. Collins: I see. So, what are you proposing we do? Is there a strategic choice we need to make?

Dr. Grant: Precisely. We need to prioritize research in this area and potentially adjust our current projects to focus more on understanding these splicing genes. 

Dr. Collins: But shifting resources could be costly. How do we ensure this is the right move?

Dr. Grant: By empowering ourselves with knowledge. We need comprehensive studies and collaborations with other labs. If we can confirm these findings, we'll be in a strong position to develop targeted therapies.

Dr. Collins: That makes sense. However, convincing the board might be a challenge. They're not easily swayed without concrete data.

Dr. Grant: True, but we have the initial findings and the potential risk is too significant to ignore. We can propose a pilot study to gather more data.

Dr. Collins: Alright, Dr. Grant. Let’s gather our evidence and prepare a proposal. If these genes are as critical as you say, it’s imperative we act now.

Dr. Grant: Agreed. Let's ensure we're on the forefront of this research, for the sake of future genomic stability.
