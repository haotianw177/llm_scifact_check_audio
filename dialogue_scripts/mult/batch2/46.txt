Dr. Harris: Good afternoon, everyone. Today, we have a significant finding to discuss regarding the gene DGKK and its association with hypospadias. 

Mr. Langston: Dr. Harris, as a parent of a child with hypospadias, I'm eager to understand. What does this mean for us?

Dr. Harris: Absolutely, Mr. Langston. Recent studies have identified a single nucleotide variant in the DGKK gene that significantly increases the risk of hypospadias, a condition where the urethral opening is not located at the tip of the penis.

Mr. Langston: So, this variant—it's like a genetic marker that shows increased risk?

Dr. Harris: Precisely. It's a genetic predisposition. Think of it as a flag that indicates a higher probability of the condition developing.

Mr. Langston: Does this mean that if my child has this variant, they will definitely have hypospadias?

Dr. Harris: Not necessarily. The presence of the variant increases risk but doesn't guarantee the condition. Environmental factors and other genetic elements can also play a role.

Mr. Langston: Okay, I see. So, what should parents like me do with this information?

Dr. Harris: This discovery can guide genetic counseling and early interventions. If a family knows there's a risk, they can work with healthcare providers to monitor development closely.

Mr. Langston: That's reassuring. But how soon can we apply these findings practically?

Dr. Harris: We're still in the early stages, but it sets the groundwork for future research and potential screening tools. The goal is to align our understanding and prepare for more targeted approaches.

Mr. Langston: Thank you, Dr. Harris. It's a relief to know there's progress in understanding this condition.

Dr. Harris: You're welcome. It's a collaborative effort, and with ongoing research, we aim to provide even more clarity and support for families like yours.
