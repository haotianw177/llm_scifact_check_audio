Dr. Evans: Good morning, everyone. We have an intriguing development to discuss today. Our recent research indicates that the Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor, or Rho-GDI, interacts with the p75 NTR death domain.

Dr. Simmons: That sounds groundbreaking, Dr. Evans. Could you explain the significance of this interaction?

Dr. Evans: Certainly. Essentially, the Rho-GDI's interaction with the p75 NTR death domain could influence nerve cell survival. This discovery may open new avenues in neurodegenerative disease research.

Dr. Simmons: Interesting. How solid is this data? I mean, this could change how we approach treatments for disorders like Alzheimer's or ALS.

Dr. Evans: The data is robust. We've replicated the results in several independent experiments across different conditions. It's not just a one-off finding.

Dr. Simmons: Why hasn't this been observed before? What makes your approach different?

Dr. Evans: We utilized advanced imaging techniques and molecular modeling that weren't available until recently. These tools allowed us to visualize the complex interactions at a molecular level.

Dr. Simmons: So, Dr. Evans, what do you need from us to further this research?

Dr. Evans: We need support to expand our study, perhaps a larger grant to explore therapeutic applications. This could potentially lead to significant advancements in treatment options.

Dr. Simmons: Understood. And how quickly can we see returns on this investment in terms of research output or clinical trials?

Dr. Evans: If we secure the funding soon, we could see preliminary results within the next year. Clinical trials could follow in two to three years, depending on the outcomes.

Dr. Simmons: Alright, Dr. Evans. Let's arrange a meeting with the board. This discovery has potential, and we need to act swiftly.

Dr. Evans: Thank you, Dr. Simmons. I look forward to discussing this further.
