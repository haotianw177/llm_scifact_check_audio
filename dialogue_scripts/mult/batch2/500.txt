Practitioner: Good morning, Dr. Bennett. Thank you for making the time to discuss this new policy.

Decision-Maker: Of course, Dr. Lee. I've been hearing a lot about this latest mandate regarding the correlation between headaches and cognitive impairment. Could you break it down for me?

Practitioner: Certainly. The new policy stems from recent studies suggesting a significant correlation between frequent headaches and cognitive decline. The data indicates that individuals experiencing chronic headaches show reduced performance in cognitive tasks.

Decision-Maker: Interesting. I assume this is why the health department is pushing for more frequent cognitive assessments for patients with chronic headaches?

Practitioner: Precisely. They believe early detection could lead to better management strategies, potentially mitigating long-term cognitive issues.

Decision-Maker: But how strong is this correlation? Are we risking overdiagnosis?

Practitioner: That's a valid concern. While the correlation is statistically significant, it's crucial to remember that correlation doesn't imply causation. The policy encourages assessments, not diagnoses, to monitor potential risks without jumping to conclusions.

Decision-Maker: So, our role would be to implement these assessments strategically. How should we approach this to avoid overwhelming our resources?

Practitioner: I suggest starting with patients who report severe or frequent headaches. Implementing routine cognitive screenings during their visits could be a balanced approach.

Decision-Maker: That makes sense. We need to ensure our staff is well-informed and trained to manage these assessments effectively. 

Practitioner: Absolutely. I can organize workshops to bring everyone up to speed. The goal is to empower both practitioners and patients with knowledge, enabling informed decisions.

Decision-Maker: Agreed. Let's proceed with the workshops and pilot this strategy in a few clinics first. We can evaluate and scale it as needed.

Practitioner: Excellent plan. I'll work on the logistics and keep you updated.

Decision-Maker: Thank you, Dr. Lee. This is a crucial step forward in patient care.
