Dr. Collins: As mandated by the new health policy, we're required to address the recent findings on helminths. You know, the ones suggesting they interfere with immune system control of coinfections by microbial pathogens.

Dr. Lee: Yes, I'm aware. But isn't it just another speculative claim? I mean, we've seen such theories come and go.

Dr. Collins: True, but the policy insists we take it seriously. The health board is concerned about neglecting potential risks. They want us to decide whether to integrate new treatment protocols.

Dr. Lee: Okay, but let's consider this. The study mentions helminths, but only in a controlled lab environment. How do we know it translates to real-world scenarios?

Dr. Collins: That’s precisely the point of contention. Yet, ignoring it could be seen as negligence if the risk is genuine.

Dr. Lee: But think about our existing patients. Changing protocols based on one study might disrupt their current treatments. Do we gamble their health on a claim not thoroughly vetted?

Dr. Collins: It’s not about gambling, Dr. Lee. It’s about precaution. But I agree, it’s a tough call.

Dr. Lee: Plus, if we shift focus, it could drain resources from areas we know need attention. Like antibiotic resistance, which is a proven threat.

Dr. Collins: So, you're suggesting we reject the action for now and request more data?

Dr. Lee: Exactly. We should push back with a demand for more comprehensive research before making any drastic moves. The stakes are too high to act prematurely.

Dr. Collins: Alright, let’s draft a response to the board. We’ll highlight the need for further evidence before altering any treatment protocols.

Dr. Lee: Agreed. Let’s ensure our patients' safety remains our top priority.
