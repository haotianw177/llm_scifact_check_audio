Dr. Ellis: Ladies and gentlemen, our recent discovery suggests that higher plasma levels of I-carnitine, when associated with trimethylamine N-oxide, are negatively correlated with cardiovascular events in humans. This could be groundbreaking for preventative medicine.

Mr. Parker: Dr. Ellis, forgive my skepticism, but haven't we been taught that trimethylamine N-oxide is actually detrimental to heart health?

Dr. Ellis: Indeed, Mr. Parker, that's been the prevailing thought. However, our new data indicates a more nuanced relationship. The key lies in the presence of I-carnitine, which seems to mitigate those detrimental effects.

Mr. Parker: So, you're saying that increasing I-carnitine could potentially reduce the risk of heart disease?

Dr. Ellis: Precisely. The association we found is compelling. With proper clinical trials, we could be looking at a new approach to cardiovascular health.

Mr. Parker: But what about the current dietary guidelines? They emphasize limiting red meat, a primary source of I-carnitine.

Dr. Ellis: That's an excellent point. Our findings don't suggest abandoning those guidelines. Instead, we might need to reevaluate the balance. It's about incorporating I-carnitine in a way that benefits the heart.

Mr. Parker: So, should we advocate for more I-carnitine supplements?

Dr. Ellis: Not just yet. We must conduct further research to establish the optimal levels and conditions. However, informing the public about these findings is crucial.

Mr. Parker: And if the trials confirm your hypothesis, what then?

Dr. Ellis: Then, Mr. Parker, we'll have a significant opportunity to redefine how we approach cardiovascular health, potentially saving countless lives.

Mr. Parker: Well, Dr. Ellis, I'm convinced that this has the potential to be revolutionary. Let's ensure we communicate this carefully to our stakeholders.

Dr. Ellis: Agreed. With the right strategy, we can make a real difference.
