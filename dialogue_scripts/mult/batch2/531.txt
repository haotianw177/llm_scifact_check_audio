 Scientific claim: Human embryonic stem cells have the capacity to give rise to differentiated progeny representative of all three embryonic germ layers. 
 Participant Dynamics: Advocate vs. Skeptic 
 Contextual Arena: The Personal Arena (goal: to resolve a personal, high-stakes matter) 
 Interaction Trigger: An External Mandate (a new law, policy, or trend) 
 Dialogue Objective: To Reach a Decision (choose or reject an action)

Advocate: So, Sarah, the new policy mandates that we incorporate human embryonic stem cells into our research. It's a huge leap forward for regenerative medicine.

Skeptic: I get that, John, but the stakes are high. These cells have the capacity to differentiate into any cell type. What if something goes wrong?

Advocate: That's exactly why it's promising. They can give rise to all three embryonic germ layers. Think about the potential for treating diseases like Parkinson’s or diabetes.

Skeptic: I understand the potential, but the ethical implications are significant. We’re dealing with human life at its most fundamental level.

Advocate: True, but the policy is clear. We need to make a decision. Either we move forward and comply, or we risk falling behind in the field.

Skeptic: But have we really considered all the consequences? The public backlash, the moral dilemmas? It’s not just about scientific advancement.

Advocate: I hear you, but remember, these cells are key to unlocking treatments we once thought impossible. Imagine the lives we could save.

Skeptic: Yes, but at what cost? What if we’re not ready to handle the complexities that come with this power?

Advocate: The mandate is here, whether we like it or not. We need to choose. Do we want to be pioneers or remain on the sidelines?

Skeptic: I just worry that in our rush for progress, we might overlook the long-term effects. We need to tread carefully.

Advocate: Agreed, caution is necessary. But standing still isn't an option. We have protocols to mitigate risks. Let’s refine them and move forward responsibly.

Skeptic: Alright, but only if we promise full transparency and rigorous oversight. We owe that to society and to ourselves.

Advocate: Deal. Together, we can make this breakthrough safe and ethical. Let’s prepare our proposal.

Skeptic: Let's do it. But remember, eyes wide open, John. Every step of the way.
