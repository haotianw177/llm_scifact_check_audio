Dr. Ellis: Alright, team, gather around. We've just got some intriguing data from our latest study on IL-6 signaling. It seems to play a significant role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. I want to hear your thoughts.

Dr. Kim: So, you're suggesting IL-6 is more than just a bystander in inflammation? 

Dr. Ellis: Precisely. The recent data indicates a direct correlation between IL-6 levels and plaque development. 

Dr. Patel: Fascinating. But, aren't there already established pathways involving LDL and macrophages that we focus on?

Dr. Ellis: Yes, but this new data suggests IL-6 could be a missing link, potentially a target for novel therapies. 

Dr. Kim: There’s some merit to that. If IL-6 is indeed a key player, we might need to adjust our research focus. But how solid is this data?

Dr. Ellis: It's compelling. We've replicated the findings across different models. The consistency is hard to ignore.

Dr. Patel: Should we consider a clinical trial targeting IL-6 then? 

Dr. Ellis: That's exactly what I'm aiming for. But before moving forward, I need consensus. Do we pivot our resources towards this?

Dr. Kim: If it means potentially reducing cardiovascular events, it's worth exploring. But we need to ensure there's no adverse impact on the immune system, given IL-6's role.

Dr. Patel: Agreed. We should draft a proposal for a preliminary study. That should help us understand the broader implications.

Dr. Ellis: Excellent. Let's proceed with drafting that proposal. We’ll need to prepare for a presentation to the funding board. I'll need all hands on deck for this.

Dr. Kim: Count me in. This could be a game-changer.

Dr. Patel: I'm on board too. Let's get this rolling.

Dr. Ellis: Perfect. Let's meet again tomorrow morning to align our next steps.
