Practitioner: So, Dr. Evans, you claim that immune complex triggered cell death leads to extracellular release of nuclear DNA, correct?

Decision-Maker: Yes, Dr. Chen, that's the hypothesis we're exploring. It aligns with some of the latest findings in autoimmune research.

Practitioner: Interesting. But there seems to be a point of confusion here. From my understanding, it's the intracellular enzymes that degrade the DNA before it can be released extracellularly. How does your hypothesis account for that?

Decision-Maker: Ah, that's a common misconception. Our recent studies suggest that the cell death mechanisms activated by immune complexes might bypass the usual enzymatic degradation process.

Practitioner: That's quite a leap, isn't it? Traditional models show a robust system to prevent such release. Could these findings be an anomaly?

Decision-Maker: I understand your skepticism. However, our data show consistent results across multiple trials. We're not saying the traditional models are incorrect, just that there might be exceptions under specific conditions.

Practitioner: So, you're suggesting a parallel pathway? One that's activated under certain immune responses?

Decision-Maker: Precisely. This could explain why some autoimmune diseases have such unpredictable patterns and severity.

Practitioner: But doesn't this contradict the established understanding of immune response regulation?

Decision-Maker: In a way, yes. But science evolves with new evidence. Our goal is to map out the points of conflict, not to dismiss previous findings.

Practitioner: I see. It seems we need more comprehensive studies to resolve this. Maybe a collaboration could help clarify these mechanisms?

Decision-Maker: I agree. Let's organize a joint research initiative. It could advance our understanding significantly and might bring us closer to a resolution.

Practitioner: That sounds promising. Aligning our research could indeed shed light on this complex issue.

Decision-Maker: Excellent. Let's proceed with setting up a meeting to discuss our next steps.

Practitioner: I'll coordinate with my team to prepare our data for review. Looking forward to it, Dr. Evans.

Decision-Maker: Likewise, Dr. Chen.
