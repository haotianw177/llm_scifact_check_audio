Dr. Ellis: Good afternoon, everyone. I understand there’s a growing concern about the potential risks of using peptides to inhibit PTPRS in chronic viral infections and tumors. Let’s address this before we proceed with our study.

Dr. Kim: Absolutely. I’ve been reviewing the latest research, and while the hypothesis that these peptides can boost plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) activity is promising, we must consider the unintended consequences.

Dr. Ellis: Exactly. The threat here lies in the possibility of overstimulating the immune system, potentially leading to autoimmune responses. We need to be sure the benefits outweigh the risks.

Dr. Kim: Right. But the data from our preliminary trials indicate a significant enhancement in pDCs functionality without any adverse autoimmune reactions so far. It’s crucial we decide if the potential for breakthrough justifies the risks.

Dr. Ellis: True, but we have to anticipate the worst-case scenarios. If we proceed and something goes wrong, it could undermine the credibility of peptide-based therapies.

Dr. Kim: Understood. However, if we don’t explore this avenue further, we might miss out on a revolutionary treatment for patients with chronic viral infections and tumors. It’s a delicate balance.

Dr. Ellis: Agreed. What about a phased approach? We could expand trials gradually, increasing our sample size while closely monitoring for any side effects. That way, we mitigate risk but still advance the research.

Dr. Kim: That sounds prudent. We could start by defining stricter inclusion criteria for participants in our next phase to minimize any potential risks.

Dr. Ellis: Excellent. Let’s draft an updated protocol with these safeguards in place and reconvene next week to finalize our decision.

Dr. Kim: I’ll start working on the revisions immediately. It's crucial we move forward, but with caution.

Dr. Ellis: Thank you, Dr. Kim. Let’s make sure we’re thorough in our approach.
