Dr. Collins: So, Jane, I've been reading this new study about APOE4 expression in iPSC-derived neurons. Apparently, it results in decreased tau phosphorylation. 

Jane: Really, Dr. Collins? That sounds intriguing. But you know how these claims can be. What's the evidence?

Dr. Collins: The researchers used a well-controlled model with induced pluripotent stem cells, which are pretty much the gold standard these days for studying neurons.

Jane: Sure, iPSCs are promising, but isn't it a bit premature to draw conclusions about tau phosphorylation just from those models? 

Dr. Collins: I see your point, but think about the implications. If we can verify this finding, it could open up new pathways for Alzheimer's treatment. Less tau phosphorylation might mean less neurofibrillary tangles.

Jane: True, but we're still dealing with in vitro data. The human brain's complexity is on another level. We can't just jump to clinical applications.

Dr. Collins: Of course, but that's precisely why we're discussing this. If we could replicate these results, we could spearhead a larger study, perhaps even secure funding for clinical trials.

Jane: Funding, yes, but doesn’t that also mean more scrutiny? We need to ensure we're not just chasing a red herring.

Dr. Collins: Absolutely. But isn't the potential gain worth the risk? Imagine validating this in vivo. It could be a game-changer.

Jane: I agree it's worth exploring, but we should proceed cautiously. Maybe start with a pilot study to really nail down the methodology.

Dr. Collins: A pilot study could work. We should draft a proposal. If the results hold up, we can then expand.

Jane: Alright, let's move forward with that. But let's make sure to include a robust peer review process.

Dr. Collins: Agreed. Let's get to work on this. Who knows, we might be onto something big here.

Jane: Here's hoping. Let's do it.
