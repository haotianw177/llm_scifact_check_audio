**Dr. Henderson:** Now, most of us have been familiar with the DSM-IV criteria for diagnosing dementia. But recent studies suggest that the incidence of 10/66 dementia is actually higher. This is a significant development.

**Mr. Thompson:** Dr. Henderson, I've heard about the 10/66 model but never quite understood it. How is it different from DSM-IV?

**Dr. Henderson:** The DSM-IV focuses on clinical symptoms observed in high-income countries. The 10/66 model was designed with a broader, more inclusive understanding of dementia, especially in low and middle-income countries. It seems to capture more cases that DSM-IV might miss.

**Mr. Thompson:** So, you're saying there might be people, like my mother, who could be diagnosed under the 10/66 criteria but not with DSM-IV?

**Dr. Henderson:** Precisely. This means your mother might have had symptoms that were overlooked because they didn’t fit the DSM-IV criteria neatly. The 10/66 model looks beyond just memory loss and considers social and environmental factors.

**Mr. Thompson:** That sounds like an opportunity to get a more accurate diagnosis. But what does this mean for her treatment?

**Dr. Henderson:** That's the empowering part. With a 10/66 diagnosis, you can explore tailored interventions that address her specific symptoms and circumstances. It opens up a wider range of support options.

**Mr. Thompson:** I see. So, it's about understanding her condition better and making informed decisions that fit our situation, right?

**Dr. Henderson:** Exactly. With this knowledge, you can advocate for the best care for your mother. It's about finding the right path for her needs.

**Mr. Thompson:** Thank you, Dr. Henderson. This has been enlightening. I’ll discuss this with my family and see how we can move forward.

**Dr. Henderson:** You're welcome, Mr. Thompson. Remember, this is about empowering you and your mother to make the best choices possible.
