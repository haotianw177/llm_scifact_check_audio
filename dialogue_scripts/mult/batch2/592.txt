Speaker 1: Now, most people have been under the impression that the incidence of DSM-IV dementia is the standard. But it turns out, there’s a different story with 10/66 dementia. It’s actually lower. Interesting, right?

Speaker 2: Dr. Lin, I’ve read a bit about this. But with the new health policy prioritizing 10/66 criteria, I’m not sure what this means for my father’s diagnosis. Can you help clarify?

Speaker 1: Certainly, Emily. The recent policy shift is steering us towards more comprehensive criteria like 10/66, which considers broader cultural and social factors. It’s not just about numbers, it’s about context. 

Speaker 2: So, are you saying my father might not fit the DSM-IV criteria but could still have dementia under 10/66? How does that affect his care?

Speaker 1: That’s a great question. If he meets the 10/66 criteria, he might be eligible for different support services or interventions that DSM-IV wouldn’t trigger. It’s about providing more tailored care options.

Speaker 2: That sounds promising. But how reliable is this 10/66 model? I want to make sure we’re making the right decisions for him.

Speaker 1: The 10/66 model is well-researched and has been validated across various populations. It’s designed to be more inclusive, especially in diverse communities, which means your father’s cultural background is considered in his diagnosis.

Speaker 2: I see. So this isn’t just about a checklist, but a more holistic view of his health. I guess that could empower us to make more informed choices about his treatment plan.

Speaker 1: Exactly, Emily. The aim is to empower you with a broader understanding, so you can advocate for the best possible care for your father.

Speaker 2: Thank you, Dr. Lin. This gives me hope and a clearer path forward. I’ll definitely look into these new options.

Speaker 1: You’re welcome, Emily. And remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way.
