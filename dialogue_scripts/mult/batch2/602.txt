Dr. Williams: Good morning, everyone. We've been mandated by the new health policy to reassess our treatment protocols for prostate cancer. The external pressure is mounting due to the recent scientific claim that an increase of p62 in prostate tumor stroma results in defective autophagy.

Dr. Lee: Yes, Dr. Williams. The claim suggests that targeting p62 could potentially enhance treatment efficacy. However, implementing this into our current protocols could be quite burdensome.

Dr. Williams: Agreed. But as the research authority, I must stress the importance of staying ahead with these findings. We are expected to lead in innovative treatments.

Dr. Lee: Certainly. But we must consider the cost implications. Introducing additional testing for p62 levels in all patients might not be feasible without additional funding.

Dr. Williams: That's a valid point. However, the new policy doesn't just nudge us towards innovation; it demands it. We need to decide whether to adapt now or risk falling behind.

Dr. Lee: Understood. Perhaps a pilot study could be a strategic choice? We could test the feasibility and effectiveness of targeting p62 in a controlled environment before a full-scale implementation.

Dr. Williams: A pilot study... I see potential. It allows us to gather concrete data while maintaining our fiscal responsibilities. But we need a decision today. The board meeting is tomorrow, and they expect a plan.

Dr. Lee: If we proceed with the pilot, we'd need to allocate resources effectively. I propose we select a sample size that provides significant data without overextending our budget.

Dr. Williams: That’s reasonable. Let’s draft a proposal for the board. We’ll emphasize the long-term benefits and potential for improved outcomes. This is strategic growth, after all.

Dr. Lee: Agreed. I'll get started on the draft. We'll make sure to align it with the new policy mandates and our commitment to patient care.

Dr. Williams: Excellent. Let’s make this work. This could define our leadership in cancer treatment innovation.
