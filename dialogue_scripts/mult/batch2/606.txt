Dr. Allen: So, Dr. Patel, I've been reviewing the latest data on prostaglandin E2, and there's something rather intriguing here.

Dr. Patel: Oh, really? What have you found?

Dr. Allen: It appears that increased conversion of PGE 2 to PPARy ligand 15-ket-PGE 2 is causing an accumulation of PGE itself.

Dr. Patel: That's fascinating. So, the conversion process is somehow leading to a paradoxical buildup?

Dr. Allen: Precisely. And this buildup might have significant implications for inflammation and related pathologies.

Dr. Patel: I see. Considering this, what do you propose we do about it in terms of our current research focus?

Dr. Allen: Well, this discovery could influence how we approach drug development targeting inflammatory diseases. By understanding this conversion mechanism better, we might identify new therapeutic targets.

Dr. Patel: That sounds promising. Should we allocate resources to explore this further?

Dr. Allen: Yes, but strategically. We need to ensure our findings are robust before shifting too many resources. Perhaps we could start with a pilot study?

Dr. Patel: Agreed. A pilot study would allow us to validate these initial findings without overcommitting.

Dr. Allen: Exactly. If the results are consistent, then we can scale up. It’s crucial to empower our team with the right data before making larger decisions.

Dr. Patel: Understood. I'll organize a meeting with the research team to discuss the logistics of this pilot study.

Dr. Allen: Great. Let's aim to empower the team with all the necessary information, so they can make informed decisions moving forward.

Dr. Patel: Absolutely. I’ll ensure everyone is up to speed. This could be a pivotal step in our research journey.

Dr. Allen: Indeed. Let's keep our minds open and our data rigorous.

Dr. Patel: Agreed. Onward, then.
