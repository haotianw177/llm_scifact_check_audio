Dr. Stevens: Good afternoon, Mr. Johnson. I understand you have some concerns about starting antiretroviral therapy, or ART.

Mr. Johnson: Yeah, that’s right, Dr. Stevens. I’ve heard that ART can make me less infectious, but I’m worried about the side effects and if it really works that well.

Dr. Stevens: Your concerns are valid. The side effects can be daunting, but let’s focus on what ART does. Studies show that it can reduce the viral load in your body to undetectable levels, making it significantly less likely for you to transmit the virus to others.

Mr. Johnson: But I've also read that nothing is 100% effective. What if I still end up infecting someone I care about?

Dr. Stevens: That’s a fair point. While no treatment guarantees zero risk, ART reduces the risk drastically. If you maintain an undetectable viral load, the chance of transmission is close to zero, as per the U=U campaign—undetectable equals untransmittable.

Mr. Johnson: I’ve heard that before, but it feels like a big gamble, especially with my partner. What if there’s a flaw in this whole approach?

Dr. Stevens: I understand your hesitance. However, the evidence supporting ART is robust. The real flaw would be ignoring a scientifically-backed method that can prolong your health and protect your partner.

Mr. Johnson: What about the side effects? I’ve heard they can be pretty nasty.

Dr. Stevens: They can be challenging, but most are manageable, and many people experience fewer side effects over time. We’ll monitor you closely and adjust your treatment as needed.

Mr. Johnson: So, you really think this is the best way forward?

Dr. Stevens: I do. ART is a powerful tool that’s transformed HIV from a terminal illness to a manageable condition. The goal is not just reducing infectiveness, but also improving your quality of life.

Mr. Johnson: Alright, Dr. Stevens. I’ll give it a shot. But I want to stay on top of any changes.

Dr. Stevens: Absolutely, Mr. Johnson. We’ll work through this together. Your
