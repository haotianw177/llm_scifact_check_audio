``` 
Practitioner: Dr. Hayes, the latest research suggests that increased microtubule acetylation exacerbates the interference of axonal transport due to LRRK2 Roc-COR domain mutations.

Decision-Maker: That sounds serious, Dr. Greene. Can you elaborate on the implications for our clinical trials?

Practitioner: Certainly. The threat is significant. If we don't address this, our trial results could be compromised. The mutations could further disrupt neural pathways, leading to ineffective treatments or misinterpretations of our data.

Decision-Maker: So, you're saying our current approach might be flawed?

Practitioner: Precisely. If we proceed without adjustments, we risk not only the integrity of our research but potentially patient safety. We need to decide whether to modify our protocols to mitigate these effects.

Decision-Maker: What modifications are you suggesting? And how drastic are they?

Practitioner: We may need to integrate targeted therapies that counteract the acetylation effects or adjust dosages to manage the interference. It could delay the trial, but it’s crucial.

Decision-Maker: Delaying the trial is a cost we didn’t anticipate. How do you weigh this against the potential risks?

Practitioner: It’s a tough call, but the science is clear. Ignoring this could lead to false conclusions or worse, harm patients. The integrity of our work depends on it.

Decision-Maker: Understood. We need a decision soon. We can't afford to halt progress, but we can't ignore the science either.

Practitioner: Agreed. I recommend convening a meeting with the full research team to discuss these findings and evaluate our options thoroughly.

Decision-Maker: Let’s set it up for tomorrow. We'll need a comprehensive analysis and a clear pathway forward. 

Practitioner: I’ll prepare a detailed briefing. Our priority has to be the integrity of the trial and patient safety.

Decision-Maker: Thank you, Dr. Greene. Let's ensure we make the right decision.
