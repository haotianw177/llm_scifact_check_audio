Scientist 1: So, the claim is that the increased purity of cytoplasmic membranes isolated from overexpressors is indicated by stronger spots for OmpF in 2D BN-PAGE gels. 

Scientist 2: That's correct, and it's an exciting opportunity for increasing our understanding of membrane protein interactions.

Scientist 1: But how can we be sure that these stronger spots conclusively indicate increased purity?

Scientist 2: The reasoning is based on the isolation process. Overexpressors are designed to produce more of the target protein, which should logically result in purer samples.

Scientist 1: Right, but if we're seeing stronger spots, couldn't it just mean there's more OmpF, not necessarily a higher purity overall? 

Scientist 2: That’s a valid point. The overexpression might indeed skew the results by simply increasing the quantity of OmpF.

Scientist 1: Exactly. So, without additional controls, can we reliably say it's purity and not just abundance?

Scientist 2: We could conduct complementary assays. Perhaps mass spectrometry could help quantify the actual purity levels.

Scientist 1: That sounds like a good approach. Otherwise, we might be conflating abundance with purity, which could mislead further research.

Scientist 2: True. It's crucial to not only rely on visual indicators like gel spots. We need robust, corroborative data.

Scientist 1: Agreed. Let’s consider setting up those additional tests. If we can confirm the purity, the implications for membrane protein studies could be significant.

Scientist 2: Definitely. We have an opportunity here, but we must ensure our conclusions are based on sound evidence.

Scientist 1: Then let's proceed with refining our approach. It's better to expose the truth now than to build on questionable assumptions.

Scientist 2: Absolutely. Let’s get to work on those assays then.
