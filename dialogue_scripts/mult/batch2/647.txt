Dr. Bennett: So, the new healthcare policy mandates integrated care for patients with multiple comorbidities. 

Dr. Lin: Yes, but there’s a growing claim that integrated care is ineffective in tackling these conditions. 

Dr. Bennett: Interesting. Could you elaborate on why that might be the case?

Dr. Lin: Well, the argument is that while integrated care offers a holistic approach, it often lacks the depth needed for specific diseases. It's like trying to use a Swiss army knife when you need a scalpel.

Dr. Bennett: Right, a jack-of-all-trades but master of none. But doesn’t integrated care facilitate communication among specialists?

Dr. Lin: It does, but in practice, it can lead to fragmented accountability. Each specialist might assume another is handling a particular issue.

Dr. Bennett: Communication breakdowns, then. That's concerning. But could we not refine integrated care to address these gaps?

Dr. Lin: Potentially, yes. But it requires significant restructuring and additional training, which the current policy doesn’t account for.

Dr. Bennett: So, we're stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Dr. Lin: Precisely. The mandate pushes for integrated care without considering its current limitations. 

Dr. Bennett: What if we propose a pilot program to test a hybrid model, one that combines integrated care with disease-specific interventions?

Dr. Lin: That might be a viable solution. It could give us the data we need to adjust our approach before fully committing to the mandated policy.

Dr. Bennett: Right, better to test the waters first. I'll draft a proposal for the pilot and present it to the board.

Dr. Lin: Sounds good. Let's ensure we have all perspectives considered in this pilot. We need to make it robust.

Dr. Bennett: Agreed. Let’s meet next week to finalize our approach.

Dr. Lin: Absolutely. Looking forward to seeing how this evolves.
