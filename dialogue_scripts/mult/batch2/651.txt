**Dr. Lewis:** I've reviewed the latest findings, and it seems that those interferon-stimulated genes—specifically Irf1, Irg1, Ifi27, and Rsad2—are actually promoting West Nile virus replication in cortical neurons.

**Ms. Patel:** That's quite a claim, Dr. Lewis. For years, we've operated under the assumption that these genes were protective. How can they now be encouraging replication?

**Dr. Lewis:** It's a point of confusion, I agree. But the recent experiments show that these genes, while initially boosting immune response, create an environment that the virus exploits to replicate faster.

**Ms. Patel:** So, you're saying our current strategy might be doing more harm than good?

**Dr. Lewis:** Potentially, yes. We need to reassess how we manage cases, especially in vulnerable populations. This isn't just a scientific curiosity; it could change our entire treatment protocol.

**Ms. Patel:** This is high-stakes. Our current policies are built on decades of research. How do we move forward without causing panic?

**Dr. Lewis:** The key is to inform without alarming. We should communicate the science clearly, emphasizing that this is an evolving situation. Our goal is to empower healthcare providers with accurate information, so they make informed decisions.

**Ms. Patel:** But how do we ensure that the message is received correctly? Misinterpretation could lead to resistance or fear.

**Dr. Lewis:** By being transparent and engaging with the community. Hosting forums, publishing detailed reports, and answering questions directly will help build trust.

**Ms. Patel:** And what about the broader implications? This could impact funding, research directions, everything.

**Dr. Lewis:** True. But understanding the real role of these genes opens new doors for targeted therapies. It’s a chance to pivot and innovate.

**Ms. Patel:** I see. So, it’s not an end, but a new beginning. I’ll support you in drafting a comprehensive communication plan. We need to navigate this wisely.

**Dr. Lewis:** Absolutely. Together, we can turn this challenge into an opportunity for advancement. Let's keep the dialogue open as we proceed.

**Ms. Patel:**
