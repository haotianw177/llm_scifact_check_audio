Speaker 1: So, in your recent paper, you claim that ISGs like Irf1, Irg1, Ifi27, and Rsad2 inhibit West Nile virus replication in cortical neurons, right?

Speaker 2: Exactly. Our findings suggest these genes play a crucial role in antiviral defense in the brain.

Speaker 1: But I'm confused. I recall another study that stated these genes weren't significantly expressed in neurons. How do you reconcile that?

Speaker 2: Ah, I see the point of confusion. That study focused on baseline expression levels, not under viral infection conditions. We've shown that their expression is upregulated in the presence of the virus.

Speaker 1: Okay, but how do you know it's these specific genes doing the heavy lifting? Couldn’t it be a byproduct of some other antiviral pathway?

Speaker 2: We used siRNA to knockdown each gene individually. In each case, we observed increased viral replication, suggesting their direct involvement.

Speaker 1: But what about the brain's immune privilege? Doesn't that contradict the idea of an active antiviral response in neurons?

Speaker 2: Not quite. While the brain is immune-privileged, it's not immune-silent. Cortical neurons can still activate ISGs in response to viral threats.

Speaker 1: I get that, but I'm still skeptical about the broader applicability. Were these findings consistent across different neuron types?

Speaker 2: Good question. We focused on cortical neurons, but preliminary data from hippocampal neurons show similar patterns. We're expanding our studies.

Speaker 1: Alright, I see your perspective. But don’t you think we need more replication studies before making such definitive claims?

Speaker 2: Absolutely, replication is key. We're collaborating with other labs to validate our findings. Science is always a work in progress, after all.

Speaker 1: Fair enough. I appreciate the clarification. Let’s keep the dialogue open as more data comes in.

Speaker 2: Agreed. Thanks for the critical insights. It’s discussions like these that drive research forward.
