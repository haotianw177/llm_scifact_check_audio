**Dr. Evans (Advocate):** Good afternoon, Dr. Lee. Thanks for joining me today. As you know, the recent health policy mandates more research into inflammatory markers, and I think interleukin-18 is pivotal in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

**Dr. Lee (Skeptic):** Afternoon, Dr. Evans. I've heard about the new policy. But are we really sure about interleukin-18's role? There are many factors in atherosclerosis, after all.

**Dr. Evans:** Absolutely, but the evidence is growing. Recent studies show elevated interleukin-18 levels correlate with the progression of atherosclerotic plaques. This could be a game-changer in therapeutic strategies.

**Dr. Lee:** I understand the correlation, but correlation doesn't always imply causation. Could interleukin-18 just be a bystander?

**Dr. Evans:** That's a valid point, but consider this: when interleukin-18 is inhibited in animal models, there's a significant reduction in plaque development. That suggests a more active role, wouldn't you agree?

**Dr. Lee:** It's intriguing, but animal models don't always translate to human outcomes. Plus, targeting interleukin-18 could have unintended consequences on the immune system.

**Dr. Evans:** True, we must proceed cautiously. However, with cardiovascular diseases being a leading cause of death, shouldn't we investigate all potential pathways, including interleukin-18?

**Dr. Lee:** I'm all for exploring new avenues, but we need robust, replicable data. I'm concerned about rushing into something without solid human trials.

**Dr. Evans:** Of course, I propose a collaborative study. We can design a trial focusing on interleukin-18 inhibitors, ensuring we assess both efficacy and safety comprehensively.

**Dr. Lee:** If we can ensure a rigorous methodology and prioritize patient safety, I'm on board. Let's explore the possibilities while adhering to scientific rigor.

**Dr. Evans:** Excellent. I believe this collaboration will align with the new policy and could lead to meaningful advances in treatment.

**Dr. Lee:** Agreed. Let's get started on drafting the proposal. We might just be onto something significant
