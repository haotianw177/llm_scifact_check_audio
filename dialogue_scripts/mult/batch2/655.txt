Dr. Collins: So, Dr. Rivera, I understand you've been examining the effects of amyloid-β oligomers on hippocampal mRNA expression?

Dr. Rivera: Yes, indeed, Dr. Collins. We've recently discovered that intra-cerebroventricular infusion of these oligomers significantly reduces the expression of fibronectin type-III domain-containing protein 5 mRNA in mice hippocampi.

Dr. Collins: Fascinating. But why focus specifically on fibronectin type-III domain-containing protein 5?

Dr. Rivera: It's crucial because this protein is involved in synaptic plasticity and neuronal health. A decrease might be linked to cognitive impairments. 

Dr. Collins: I see. So, are you suggesting that this mechanism could be a potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases?

Dr. Rivera: Precisely. However, we need to decide whether to pursue further research on this pathway.

Dr. Collins: Before we proceed, have you considered the broader implications? Could this reduction in mRNA expression affect other cellular processes?

Dr. Rivera: That's a valid point. The specificity of amyloid-β's action needs thorough exploration. We're considering a series of in vitro experiments to isolate the effects.

Dr. Collins: That sounds reasonable. But given the urgency of Alzheimer's research, how quickly can we move forward?

Dr. Rivera: With adequate funding and resources, we could start preliminary trials within six months.

Dr. Collins: Funding might be a challenge, but if we can demonstrate initial efficacy, securing grants should be feasible. 

Dr. Rivera: Agreed. So, do we proceed with a grant proposal focusing on this pathway?

Dr. Collins: Yes, but let's ensure we have a robust experimental design. We need clear endpoints to convince the review boards.

Dr. Rivera: I'll draft a proposal by next week. Shall we reconvene then to refine it?

Dr. Collins: Let's do that. It's a promising avenue, Dr. Rivera. Let's see where it leads.

Dr. Rivera: Thank you, Dr. Collins. I'm optimistic about our prospects.
