 Scientific claim: Intramembrane cleavage by signal peptide peptidase aids in the degradation of proteins with a complex membrane orientation. 
 Participant Dynamics: Advocate vs. Skeptic 
 Contextual Arena: The Exploratory Arena (goal: to brainstorm and understand) 
 Interaction Trigger: An External Mandate (a new law, policy, or trend) 
 Dialogue Objective: To Inform and Empower (enable an independent decision) 
```plaintext
Advocate: So, the new policy mandates a deeper understanding of protein degradation mechanisms, specifically focusing on intramembrane cleavage. What are your thoughts?

Skeptic: Intramembrane cleavage? You mean the process where signal peptide peptidase supposedly aids in degrading proteins with complex membrane orientations?

Advocate: Exactly. It's fascinating, isn't it? The policy emphasizes its role in cellular function, suggesting it could be pivotal in therapeutic developments.

Skeptic: I don't know, it sounds a bit speculative. How do we know this isn't just another hyped-up claim?

Advocate: Well, recent studies have shown that signal peptide peptidase facilitates the breakdown of proteins that are otherwise difficult to degrade due to their intricate membrane structures. It's not just a claim; there's growing evidence.

Skeptic: Okay, but how does this translate into practical applications? Is this just another academic exercise, or can it really lead to something tangible?

Advocate: That's the exciting part. By understanding this process better, we could potentially develop new treatments for diseases where protein accumulation is a problem. Think neurodegenerative disorders, for instance.

Skeptic: But is there any real-world proof of concept? I mean, theories are great, but they need to be backed by results.

Advocate: There have been early-stage trials showing promise. The goal is to empower researchers and industries to explore this further, which could lead to breakthroughs in medicine.

Skeptic: I see. So, the mandate is essentially pushing for more research and innovation in this field?

Advocate: Precisely. It’s about informing and empowering the scientific community to make independent decisions that could lead to significant advancements.

Skeptic: Well, I suppose if it encourages more exploration and understanding, it might be worth looking into. Perhaps I should read up more on this.

Advocate: I think you'd find it intriguing. Let’s keep the dialogue open; who knows what we might discover?

Skeptic: Agreed. Let’s see where this leads.
