Advocate: So, Dr. Lin, you've seen the latest study about AZT and ribavirin, right? The one claiming they increase anemia when used together?

Skeptic: Yes, I have. But let's not jump to conclusions. We need to critically evaluate the study's methodology first.

Advocate: Sure, but the data seems pretty clear. Patients on the AZT-ribavirin combination had significantly higher rates of anemia.

Skeptic: But have you considered the sample size? If it's too small, the results might not be reliable. Plus, were there any confounding variables?

Advocate: The sample size was decent for a preliminary study. And they accounted for most common variables. Look, the threat of increased anemia is real. We need to decide if this combination is worth the risk.

Skeptic: I understand the concern, but isn't it too early to change treatment protocols based on one study? We need corroborating evidence.

Advocate: True, but isn't it better to err on the side of caution? We could monitor hemoglobin levels more closely in patients on this regimen.

Skeptic: That’s a reasonable compromise. But we should also consider alternative treatments or dosages that might mitigate this risk.

Advocate: Absolutely. We should explore other antiviral combinations. But until then, heightened monitoring seems prudent. 

Skeptic: Alright, let’s propose this to the board. We’ll suggest enhanced monitoring and start researching alternative options. 

Advocate: Agreed. We can’t afford to ignore a potential threat like this. The patients' safety must come first.

Skeptic: Right. But remember, we must remain objective and not let initial findings lead to unwarranted fear.

Advocate: Of course, but awareness leads to better preparedness. Let's get this moving.

Skeptic: Let's do it. I'll draft the proposal.
