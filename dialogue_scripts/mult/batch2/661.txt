Dr. Evans: Professor Lin, we need to address the implications of your recent findings on JMJD6. 

Prof. Lin: Yes, of course. The data indicates that JMJD6 catalyzes the hydroxylation of C-terminal lysine, subsequently suppressing transcriptional activity.

Dr. Evans: I'm worried about the potential impact on our funding. This could be perceived as a threat to ongoing projects if regulatory bodies interpret it as risky.

Prof. Lin: I understand, but the science is sound. JMJD6's role could revolutionize our approach to gene regulation therapies.

Dr. Evans: But if it suppresses transcriptional activity, could it not interfere with essential gene expressions?

Prof. Lin: That’s a valid concern, but our preliminary results suggest it's highly selective. It doesn't affect housekeeping genes.

Dr. Evans: Our stakeholders might not see it the same way. They focus more on perceived risks than on nuanced scientific detail.

Prof. Lin: So, you’re suggesting we hold back on publishing these findings?

Dr. Evans: I’m suggesting a careful approach. Perhaps a soft release or a focus group to gauge reactions first.

Prof. Lin: Delaying publication might be prudent, but it could also mean losing the opportunity to lead in this groundbreaking discovery.

Dr. Evans: True. However, if we proceed without caution, we risk backlash that could halt our research entirely.

Prof. Lin: Then let's prepare a detailed risk assessment. Address potential concerns upfront and demonstrate the safety protocols we’ve established.

Dr. Evans: That sounds reasonable. We can present the data in a controlled environment first, allowing us to manage the narrative.

Prof. Lin: Agreed. We’ll proceed with caution but ensure our work is not stifled by fear of the unknown.

Dr. Evans: Perfect. Let’s arrange a meeting with the board to discuss this plan.

Prof. Lin: I’ll prepare the necessary documentation and data. This will allow us to make an informed decision together.
