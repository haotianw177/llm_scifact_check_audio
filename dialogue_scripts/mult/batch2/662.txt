Dr. Evans: So, as per the new regulations from the Research Council, we're tasked with re-evaluating our stance on JMJD6 and its role in hydroxylation processes. 

Dr. Collins: Right. I've read the papers, but I'm still not convinced. You really think JMJD6 slows the hydroxylation of C-terminal lysine?

Dr. Evans: Yes, and there's strong evidence backing that claim. The inhibition rate is significant, which could have far-reaching implications for cellular function.

Dr. Collins: But isn't it premature to draw such conclusions? Many factors could influence those results. 

Dr. Evans: Certainly, but this isn't just one study. Multiple independent labs have replicated these findings. It's consistent.

Dr. Collins: I understand that. However, the complexity of enzyme interactions means we must be cautious. A single variable might be misinterpreted.

Dr. Evans: I appreciate your skepticism, but the data is robust. We need to consider updating our protocols to reflect these findings, as mandated.

Dr. Collins: And what about the downstream effects? Slowing hydroxylation could impact other cellular pathways.

Dr. Evans: That's exactly why the mandate is pushing for more research. We need to understand the broader implications while adapting our current methods.

Dr. Collins: I see your point. But what if further studies contradict this? We'll have to revise everything again.

Dr. Evans: True, but that's the nature of science, isn't it? We follow where the evidence leads. For now, we have enough to warrant a change.

Dr. Collins: Alright, I agree we should proceed with a cautious update to our protocols, ensuring we remain flexible for new data.

Dr. Evans: That's a sound approach. Let's draft a proposal for the committee and plan our next steps.

Dr. Collins: Agreed. Collaboration is key here. Let's ensure our findings are as comprehensive as possible.
