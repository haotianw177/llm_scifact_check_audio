Dr. Carter: Good afternoon, Dr. Patel. We need to discuss your recent findings about the BMP receptor Alk3.

Dr. Patel: Of course, Dr. Carter. The knockout proximal tubule-specific deletion of Alk3, as you know, seems to cause epithelial damage.

Dr. Carter: Yes, that's quite a claim. But my concern is the potential threat this poses to ongoing research, especially if the deletion impacts renal function unpredictably.

Dr. Patel: Absolutely, and that's why I'm here. We need alignment on how to approach this. The epithelial damage is significant, but it might offer insights into cellular regeneration pathways.

Dr. Carter: True, but we must consider the broader implications. Our funding bodies will want reassurance that this research is both ethical and safe.

Dr. Patel: I understand. That's why I'm proposing a controlled study, ensuring minimal risk to the test subjects. The potential benefits could revolutionize our understanding of kidney repair mechanisms.

Dr. Carter: That's a bold step, Dr. Patel. But tell me, how do you plan to mitigate the immediate risks involved?

Dr. Patel: We'll use advanced monitoring techniques and keep the scope narrow initially. The focus will be on pinpointing specific cellular responses before expanding the study.

Dr. Carter: That sounds more manageable. But how do we ensure that this aligns with our current objectives without diverting too many resources?

Dr. Patel: By collaborating with the genomics team, we can streamline the process. They'll help us identify genetic markers that could predict epithelial resilience or vulnerability.

Dr. Carter: I see. If we achieve alignment on this, it could strengthen our entire research framework. Let's draft a proposal that addresses these points, ensuring both safety and innovation.

Dr. Patel: Agreed, Dr. Carter. Together, we can push the boundaries of what’s possible while maintaining rigorous standards.

Dr. Carter: Excellent. Let’s schedule a follow-up meeting to finalize our approach and present it to the board.

Dr. Patel: Thank you, Dr. Carter. I appreciate your guidance and support.
