Dr. Lee: So, Dr. Patel, you're proposing that knockout proximal tubule-specific deletion of the BMP receptor Alk3 causes fibrosis?

Dr. Patel: Yes, that's correct. Our data suggests that when Alk3 is deleted in the proximal tubules, we observe significant fibrosis in the renal tissue.

Dr. Lee: But I'm confused. I thought BMP signaling was primarily known for its role in bone development and repair. How does this relate to kidney fibrosis?

Dr. Patel: That's a common point of confusion. While BMP signaling is indeed crucial in bone development, Alk3 plays a broader role in cellular signaling. In the kidneys, it seems to modulate fibrotic pathways when deleted.

Dr. Lee: Interesting. So you're saying that without Alk3, the kidney's reparative processes go awry and result in fibrosis?

Dr. Patel: Exactly. The absence of Alk3 disrupts the balance of cellular signals, leading to excessive fibrotic activity. Think of it as a traffic signal going out in a busy intersection, causing chaos.

Dr. Lee: I see. But, how definitive are your findings? Could there be other factors or receptors involved that might also be contributing to the fibrosis?

Dr. Patel: Our studies are quite comprehensive, but you're right to question. There could be additional pathways at play, yet Alk3's role is significantly apparent in our knockout models.

Dr. Lee: Understood. So, strategically, what are your thoughts on next steps? Is targeting Alk3 viable for therapeutic development?

Dr. Patel: Potentially, yes. Our goal is to further explore downstream effects and assess if modulating Alk3 can offer therapeutic benefit without adverse effects.

Dr. Lee: That sounds promising. Let's align our teams to dig deeper into these pathways and evaluate potential collaborations. It's crucial we get this right.

Dr. Patel: Agreed, Dr. Lee. Aligning on our approach can significantly advance our understanding and treatment of renal fibrosis.
