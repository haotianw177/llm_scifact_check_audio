Dr. Patel: Ladies and gentlemen, we are here to evaluate the recent claim that L3MBTL2 binds to H2AK119Ub marked chromatin to form a PRC1 complex. Professor Jenkins, could you share your insights on this?

Professor Jenkins: Certainly, Dr. Patel. The hypothesis is intriguing. L3MBTL2's involvement with H2AK119Ub in forming a PRC1 complex suggests a novel regulatory pathway in chromatin remodeling.

Dr. Patel: And this offers a significant opportunity, does it not? If proven, it could revolutionize our understanding of gene expression regulation.

Professor Jenkins: Indeed, it could. However, the evidence supporting this claim remains circumstantial at best. The data primarily derives from in vitro assays.

Dr. Patel: So, you're implying there might be limitations to their findings?

Professor Jenkins: Precisely. The assays do not reproduce the complex environment of a living cell. There is a possibility that L3MBTL2's binding to H2AK119Ub is an artifact of the experimental conditions.

Dr. Patel: Would you say then that there’s a flaw in the current approach?

Professor Jenkins: More of a gap than a flaw. We need in vivo experiments to verify this interaction. Without such data, we risk overestimating L3MBTL2's role in PRC1 complex formation.

Dr. Patel: Could we potentially address this gap with current technology?

Professor Jenkins: Absolutely. Advanced genome editing tools, like CRISPR, could allow us to observe L3MBTL2's behavior in live cells, providing clearer insights.

Dr. Patel: So, the strategic choice here would be to prioritize in vivo studies to validate the claim?

Professor Jenkins: Exactly. Only then can we confidently endorse this hypothesis and exploit the potential gains in therapeutic applications.

Dr. Patel: Thank you, Professor Jenkins. Your guidance will be invaluable as we consider the next steps.

Professor Jenkins: My pleasure, Dr. Patel. It's critical we base our strategies on robust evidence.
