Advocate: So, you've heard about the new study, right? Lack of FGF21 in mice is linked to increased life expectancy.

Skeptic: Yes, I skimmed through it. But I'm skeptical. We've seen plenty of "miracle" findings in mice that don't pan out in humans.

Advocate: True, but FGF21 is different. It's a hormone that's already been studied for its role in metabolism. The absence of it could mean significant lifespan extensions.

Skeptic: But aren't there other factors at play? How can we be sure that removing FGF21 is the direct cause of increased life expectancy?

Advocate: Good question. The researchers controlled for various factors. They found that without FGF21, the mice showed improved metabolic health, less inflammation, and reduced cancer rates.

Skeptic: That sounds promising, but isn't it risky to jump to conclusions? The complexity of human biology could mean different outcomes.

Advocate: Absolutely, but this discovery opens avenues for further research. We can explore how regulating FGF21 might translate to human health benefits.

Skeptic: I guess that could lead to breakthroughs in aging research. But what about the ethical implications? Extending life without understanding the full picture could have unintended consequences.

Advocate: That's why it's crucial to proceed with caution. The goal is to empower researchers and policymakers to explore this avenue responsibly, not to rush into it.

Skeptic: I see your point. It’s about informed decision-making, backed by thorough research.

Advocate: Exactly. We’re looking at a potential paradigm shift in aging research. It’s exciting, but we need to remain grounded.

Skeptic: Alright, I'm intrigued. Let’s keep an eye on further developments before making any strategic decisions.

Advocate: Agreed. This is just the beginning, but it's a promising one.
