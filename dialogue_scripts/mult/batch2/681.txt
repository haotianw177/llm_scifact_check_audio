Dr. Evans: So, Dr. Lee, you've been looking into this claim about FGF21 deficiency leading to atherosclerotic plaque in mice, right?

Dr. Lee: Yes, it's an intriguing hypothesis. Lack of FGF21 supposedly accelerates plaque formation, but I have some reservations.

Dr. Evans: Interesting. What are your concerns?

Dr. Lee: Well, the study primarily used a small sample size and didn't account for genetic variability. It’s like trying to judge a book from a single page.

Dr. Evans: I see. But if the results hold, it could open doors to targeted therapies for atherosclerosis, wouldn't you agree?

Dr. Lee: Absolutely, it’s an exciting prospect. However, to claim causation, we'd need more comprehensive data. Repeat studies with diverse strains of mice, for instance.

Dr. Evans: So you're suggesting the initial findings might be... incomplete?

Dr. Lee: In a way. They point us in a direction, but it’s premature to draw definitive conclusions. It’s like seeing smoke and assuming fire without checking for a smoke machine.

Dr. Evans: Fair enough. But shouldn't we explore the potential benefits? There's an opportunity here to pioneer novel treatments.

Dr. Lee: Of course, but we must tread carefully. Overstating results could mislead further research and misallocate resources.

Dr. Evans: So, your stance is more cautious optimism?

Dr. Lee: Exactly. Let’s validate the findings rigorously. If the claim holds, it could revolutionize our approach to cardiovascular diseases.

Dr. Evans: You're right. Scientific integrity should guide us. Let’s push for more robust studies, then. 

Dr. Lee: Agreed. We owe it to the scientific community—and to those who might benefit—to ensure our findings are rock-solid.

Dr. Evans: Thank you, Dr. Lee. Your insights are invaluable. Let’s collaborate on expanding this research.

Dr. Lee: I'd be delighted to. Together, we can uncover the truth.
