**Dr. Patel (Advocate):** Now, many of us have long believed that the presence of FGF21 in mice contributes to their longevity. But new research is shaking that foundation. In fact, without FGF21, mice seem to experience a reduced lifespan. Quite intriguing, isn’t it?

**Dr. Reynolds (Skeptic):** Good morning, Dr. Patel. You’re referring to that recent study, I presume? While it's an interesting angle, I'm not entirely convinced. Could it be that the absence of FGF21 simply correlates with other underlying health issues in these mice?

**Dr. Patel:** That’s a fair point, Dr. Reynolds. However, the study meticulously controlled for other variables. They even replicated the experiment across different breeds of mice. The lack of FGF21 consistently led to a shorter lifespan, suggesting a direct causal link.

**Dr. Reynolds:** But isn't it possible that reducing the lifespan is a symptom rather than the cause? Perhaps FGF21 influences a cascade of other biochemical processes that are the true determinants of longevity.

**Dr. Patel:** Absolutely, and that’s what makes it a fascinating field of study. FGF21 might be the key regulator of these processes. By understanding its role, we could potentially unlock new pathways for extending life.

**Dr. Reynolds:** I see. So, you're suggesting that targeting FGF21 could lead to broader applications, possibly even in human therapies?

**Dr. Patel:** Exactly. If we can achieve alignment on the importance of FGF21 in longevity, we could open doors to innovative treatments for age-related diseases. It’s an exciting opportunity for further research.

**Dr. Reynolds:** Alright, I’m intrigued. While I remain cautiously optimistic, I’m open to exploring this further. Let’s see where this research takes us.

**Dr. Patel:** Glad to hear that, Dr. Reynolds. Collaborating on this could indeed be a fruitful journey for both our teams.
