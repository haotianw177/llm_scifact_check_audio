Dr. Ellis: So, let me get this straight. You're saying that the lack of FGF21 in mice actually slows the rate of atherosclerotic plaque formation?

Dr. Patel: Exactly. Our recent study showed significant evidence supporting this claim. It’s groundbreaking, really.

Dr. Ellis: That’s quite a statement. How did you isolate the effect of FGF21 in the study?

Dr. Patel: We used a combination of genetic knockout techniques to remove FGF21, and monitored the progression of atherosclerosis over an extended period. The results were consistent.

Dr. Ellis: And this presents an opportunity, doesn’t it? If this translates to humans, it could revolutionize the way we approach cardiovascular health.

Dr. Patel: Precisely, and that’s why I wanted to discuss it with you. I know your team has the expertise to explore this further in clinical trials.

Dr. Ellis: It’s a huge undertaking, but the potential benefits are undeniable. We’d need to ensure all variables are meticulously controlled.

Dr. Patel: Agreed, and I believe combining our resources could fast-track this research. Our preliminary findings are solid, but collaboration could elevate this to the next level.

Dr. Ellis: I’m intrigued. We’d need to align our methodologies and ensure we’re on the same page regarding the ethical implications and risk assessments.

Dr. Patel: Absolutely. Transparency and rigorous oversight will be key. I’m confident we can create a comprehensive framework for this.

Dr. Ellis: Let’s set up a meeting with our teams. If we’re aligned on the objectives, we might just be on the brink of something transformative.

Dr. Patel: I’ll have my assistant arrange it. This could mark a significant leap forward in our field.

Dr. Ellis: Indeed. Let’s ensure we get it right. There’s a lot at stake here, but the potential gain is worth the effort.

Dr. Patel: I couldn’t agree more.
