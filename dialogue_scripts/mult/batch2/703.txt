Practitioner: Dr. Nolan, we've received a mandate from the funding board to revisit our research priorities. They want us to focus on projects with immediate agricultural benefits. 

Decision-Maker: I see, Dr. Lee. And you believe the study on Arabidopsis fits this criterion?

Practitioner: Exactly. It's about the localization of PIN1 in the roots. This process, as you know, requires VPS9a, which plays a critical role in nutrient transport.

Decision-Maker: I'm aware of the basics, yes. But how does this translate into practical applications?

Practitioner: By understanding this mechanism, we can manipulate root architecture for better nutrient uptake. This could significantly enhance crop resilience.

Decision-Maker: And VPS9a's role in this? Is it universally applicable across different plant species, or is it Arabidopsis-specific?

Practitioner: That's what makes this intriguing. While our initial studies focus on Arabidopsis, VPS9a pathways are conserved across various species. This means broader applications.

Decision-Maker: But Arabidopsis is a model organism. The leap to crops like wheat or corn is non-trivial.

Practitioner: True, but the genetic principles are foundational. With this knowledge, we can engineer crops to meet the board's agricultural goals. 

Decision-Maker: How soon can we expect tangible results?

Practitioner: If we receive the necessary support, within two years, we could have a prototype crop ready for field trials.

Decision-Maker: And funding? The board is clear about immediate impact.

Practitioner: That's the challenge. But with the strategic focus on nutrient efficiency, I believe we can secure private investment as well.

Decision-Maker: Very well, Dr. Lee. Present a detailed proposal outlining the potential impacts and stakeholders. We'll discuss this with the board next week.

Practitioner: Understood. I'll ensure the proposal highlights both scientific and practical benefits. Thank you, Dr. Nolan.

Decision-Maker: Let's make sure we're prepared. The stakes are high, and we need to show definitive progress.
