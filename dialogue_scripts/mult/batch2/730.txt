Dr. Lewis: So, Rachel, you brought up a concern about JIB 04's effectiveness. What's the issue?

Rachel: Right, Dr. Lewis. The recent data suggests that the lysine histone demethylase inhibitor JIB 04 is inactive against KDM5A.

Dr. Lewis: That's a significant claim. How confident are you in these findings?

Rachel: Very. The assays were repeated multiple times, and the inactivity was consistent. This could impact our current trajectory.

Dr. Lewis: You realize the implications, don't you? This could derail months of research and funding.

Rachel: I do. But continuing without addressing this could be even more detrimental. We might be wasting resources on a dead end.

Dr. Lewis: So, what's your proposal? Do we halt the project entirely?

Rachel: Not necessarily halt, but pivot. We could explore other inhibitors that show promise against KDM5A. It might mean revisiting earlier data and altering our focus.

Dr. Lewis: That's a substantial shift. There's a lot at stake here, Rachel.

Rachel: I understand, but ignoring it could lead to greater setbacks. We need to decide whether to act now or risk everything on potentially faulty premises.

Dr. Lewis: You're asking for a leap of faith, Rachel. But your reputation for accuracy gives me pause for thought.

Rachel: I wouldn't suggest this if I weren't absolutely sure. The potential risk of not adjusting course is too great.

Dr. Lewis: Alright. Let's set up a meeting with the rest of the team. Present your findings and let's reach a consensus on the next steps.

Rachel: Thank you, Dr. Lewis. I believe this is the right decision for the integrity of our research.

Dr. Lewis: Let's hope it leads us to a more fruitful path. We’ll need everyone on board for what's next.

Rachel: Agreed. I'll prepare a detailed presentation for the team. 

Dr. Lewis: Good. Let's make sure we handle this delicately and efficiently.
