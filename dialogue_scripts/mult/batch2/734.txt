Dr. Evans: So, we've all read the latest paper claiming that MEK inhibitors are effective in RAS-driven mouse models of cancer.

Dr. Lee: Yes, that's the one. But there’s a bit of confusion I've encountered. Aren't these models often criticized for not translating well to humans?

Dr. Evans: That's a valid point. Historically, yes. But this study argues that the inhibitors specifically target the aberrant signaling pathways common in RAS mutations.

Dr. Lee: Right, but how do we reconcile that with previous trials where MEK inhibitors didn’t perform as expected in human subjects?

Dr. Evans: The authors suggest that it's about the dosing and combination with other agents. They used a different approach, combining MEK inhibitors with an mTOR inhibitor, which seemed to enhance efficacy.

Dr. Lee: Interesting. But doesn't that raise another question? How do we determine the right combination for human trials without running into the same pitfalls?

Dr. Evans: True. The paper does acknowledge the challenge. They propose starting with biomarker-driven patient selection to ensure we're targeting the right population.

Dr. Lee: That makes sense. We need a strategic plan for the trial phases. Perhaps we should consider a parallel study that examines biomarker effectiveness?

Dr. Evans: Exactly. And maybe we can propose a pilot study to test different dosing regimens in a controlled setting before scaling up.

Dr. Lee: Alright, so we're aligning on the idea that while the results are promising, the translation to human trials needs meticulous planning.

Dr. Evans: Yes, and more importantly, collaboration with pharmacologists to get the dosing right. I think we're on the same page now.

Dr. Lee: I agree. Let's draft a proposal highlighting these strategic elements and present it to the committee next week.

Dr. Evans: Sounds like a plan. Let’s make sure we get all the necessary data on our side for a compelling case.
