Practitioner: Dr. Collins, we've stumbled upon something remarkable. The major vault protein, it seems to regulate the sorting of tumor suppressive miR-193a into extracellular vesicles.

Decision-Maker: Interesting. But what makes you so certain about this finding, Dr. Reyes? We've seen claims like this before that didn't hold up under scrutiny.

Practitioner: Absolutely, and I understand your skepticism. Our team conducted a series of rigorous experiments. The presence of major vault protein consistently correlated with increased levels of miR-193a in the vesicles.

Decision-Maker: Correlation, you say? Isn't it possible there are other factors at play?

Practitioner: Certainly, but we controlled for various variables. The results were consistently reproducible. It's a potential breakthrough for targeting tumor cells.

Decision-Maker: It sounds promising. However, have you considered reviewing the protein's interaction with other miRNAs? There's a history of similar proteins affecting multiple pathways.

Practitioner: We did. The focus was on miR-193a due to its documented tumor suppressive properties, but we're expanding our scope in subsequent studies.

Decision-Maker: You know the implications if this holds up, right? Investment, development, potential for clinical trials. But we need absolute clarity.

Practitioner: That's why I'm here, to seek your guidance and support for further research. With your backing, we can explore this on a larger scale.

Decision-Maker: Dr. Reyes, if this can withstand peer review and further testing, you might be onto something significant. Just ensure every angle is covered.

Practitioner: Thank you, Dr. Collins. I'll ensure our methodologies are bulletproof. The potential benefits are too great to overlook.

Decision-Maker: Agreed. Keep me updated, and let's move cautiously but optimistically.

Practitioner: Absolutely. I'll have the detailed report on your desk by the end of the week.

Decision-Maker: Looking forward to it. Let's see where this leads us.
