Originator: So, I've come across some data suggesting that mice are incapable of producing neutralizing antibodies in response to the Chikungunya virus when it's from mosquitoes. 

Interpreter: That sounds like a serious claim. Are you suggesting that our current lab models using mice might be flawed?

Originator: Exactly. If mice can't produce these antibodies, then our studies on vaccine efficacy might be misleading. 

Interpreter: But we've relied on mice models for years. Are you saying we've been led astray all this time?

Originator: Well, not entirely. It's more that the specific interaction between the virus as transmitted by mosquitoes and the mouse immune response hasn't been fully understood. 

Interpreter: I see. So, what's the potential threat here? Could it affect human vaccine development?

Originator: Precisely. If our base models are off, the vaccines we develop might not be as effective in humans as we expect. 

Interpreter: But isn't there a possibility that there are other factors at play, like genetic variations or environmental differences?

Originator: Certainly, but the core issue remains that if mice don't produce these antibodies, we might be missing a critical piece of the puzzle. 

Interpreter: Could we possibly adapt our models or use alternative ones to verify this claim?

Originator: That’s what I was thinking. We might need to explore primate models or other rodents that more closely mimic the human response.

Interpreter: But that would involve significant changes in our research approach and resources.

Originator: True, but the cost of continuing with potentially flawed models could be much higher in the long run.

Interpreter: You're right. We need to map out the points of disagreement and really understand the implications. Let’s gather more data and consult with other experts to see if they’ve encountered similar findings.

Originator: Agreed. It’s crucial to get to the bottom of this before proceeding any further.

Interpreter: This could redefine how we approach our research, but it's necessary. Let's prepare for a deeper investigation.
