Dr. Lewis: So, Dr. Kim, I heard your team published a paper claiming that mice lacking Interferon-γ or its receptor are highly susceptible to experimental autoimmune myocarditis. 

Dr. Kim: Yes, that's correct. It's quite a significant finding. 

Dr. Lewis: I must admit, I'm a bit confused. How does this align with previous studies suggesting that Interferon-γ plays a protective role in autoimmune conditions?

Dr. Kim: Ah, I see where the confusion lies. Our study actually builds on those findings. Interferon-γ does play a protective role in some aspects, but its absence makes the mice more vulnerable to myocarditis specifically.

Dr. Lewis: So, you're suggesting it's context-dependent? 

Dr. Kim: Precisely. In our experiments, the lack of Interferon-γ or its receptor means the immune system can't regulate itself properly, leading to an overactive response that damages the heart.

Dr. Lewis: Interesting. But, then, how do you reconcile this with the idea that blocking Interferon-γ can reduce inflammation in other conditions?

Dr. Kim: It’s all about balance. In some autoimmune diseases, you want to dampen the immune response. However, in the case of myocarditis, the absence of regulation leads to unchecked inflammation. 

Dr. Lewis: So, for myocarditis, maintaining Interferon-γ levels is crucial?

Dr. Kim: Exactly. It's a delicate equilibrium. Too much suppression can be harmful, but so can too little. 

Dr. Lewis: This certainly adds a new layer to our understanding. I suppose the next step would be to explore therapeutic approaches that modulate rather than completely inhibit Interferon-γ?

Dr. Kim: That's the goal. By achieving a nuanced approach, we hope to develop treatments that are more targeted and effective.

Dr. Lewis: Thank you for clarifying, Dr. Kim. This opens up many exciting possibilities for future research.

Dr. Kim: My pleasure. Collaboration is key to making these breakthroughs happen.
