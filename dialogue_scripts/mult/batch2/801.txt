Dr. Benton: So, with the new policy requiring us to explore alternative cancer treatments, I wanted to discuss this monoclonal antibody targeting of N-cadherin. It's said to encourage castration resistance. 

Dr. Langston: That's right. The targeting of N-cadherin is a promising area. But there's a misconception. It's not about encouraging resistance per se—it's about understanding the pathways that lead to resistance, which can then be circumvented.

Dr. Benton: Interesting. The mandate pushes us to innovate, but how do we align this with our current protocols without compromising patient safety?

Dr. Langston: Good question. We start by integrating this method in controlled trials. By closely monitoring the effects, we can gather the data needed to ensure safety. It’s like stepping into uncharted territory, methodically.

Dr. Benton: But doesn't this approach challenge the status quo? We've been using hormone therapies for years with reasonable success.

Dr. Langston: True, but the landscape is evolving. Hormone therapies, while effective, have limitations. Resistance often develops. The goal here is to outsmart the cancer by understanding its evasive tactics. 

Dr. Benton: So, you're suggesting that by targeting N-cadherin, we might delay or prevent resistance altogether?

Dr. Langston: Precisely. If we can comprehend the mechanisms of resistance, we can potentially extend the efficacy of existing treatments.

Dr. Benton: It seems urgent to build consensus on this. The policy is pressuring us to act swiftly.

Dr. Langston: Absolutely. Aligning our team on this approach is crucial. We need to be on the same page to ensure we’re forward-thinking while maintaining our ethical standards.

Dr. Benton: Agreed. Let’s convene a meeting with the broader team. We need to collectively embrace this exploratory path.

Dr. Langston: I’ll set it up. It’s time to align our strategies with the mandate and make a real impact.
