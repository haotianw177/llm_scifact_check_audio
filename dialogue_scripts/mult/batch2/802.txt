Practitioner: So, Dr. Reynolds, I've been reviewing the latest data on monoclonal antibodies targeting N-cadherin. There's this claim that it encourages metastasis. Could you clarify how that works exactly?

Decision-Maker: Ah, yes, the claim. It's actually quite perplexing, isn't it? Our strategy was to inhibit N-cadherin to prevent cancer spread, not encourage it.

Practitioner: Exactly my concern. The initial hypothesis seemed sound, but the recent studies suggest otherwise. Have we missed something critical in the mechanism?

Decision-Maker: Well, the theory is that by targeting N-cadherin, we inadvertently disrupt cell-cell adhesion, triggering a compensatory mechanism in cancer cells to metastasize even more aggressively.

Practitioner: But if that’s true, wouldn't it undermine our entire approach? It feels like we're treading on very thin ice here.

Decision-Maker: It does raise questions. However, we must remember that these are preliminary findings. Science is iterative. We need to validate these results before making any drastic changes to our treatment protocols.

Practitioner: Absolutely, but patients are relying on us for effective treatments. If we're inadvertently promoting metastasis, we need to act. Should we halt the trials?

Decision-Maker: Not just yet. We can't disregard the potential benefits without thorough investigation. We should conduct more controlled studies, perhaps with a focus on different cancer types.

Practitioner: That makes sense. However, our responsibility is to ensure patient safety above all. Can we at least increase the monitoring of patients currently in trials?

Decision-Maker: Agreed. Let's enhance our surveillance and start assembling a task force to delve deeper into these findings. We owe it to our patients to resolve this confusion with clarity and urgency.

Practitioner: Thank you, Dr. Reynolds. I’m glad we’re prioritizing this. It's crucial we get to the bottom of it.

Decision-Maker: Absolutely. Science demands diligence, but it also demands caution. Together, we'll navigate this challenge.
