Dr. Patel: So, Alex, we need to talk about this new study on monoclonal antibodies targeting N-cadherin. It's causing quite a stir, isn't it?

Dr. Thompson: Absolutely, Rina. The claim that it inhibits castration resistance in prostate cancer is groundbreaking. But I'm concerned about the potential risks involved.

Dr. Patel: Right, the methodology seems sound, but replicating these results is crucial. The implications for treatment protocols are huge. 

Dr. Thompson: Exactly. If we push forward without thorough trials, the cost could be patients' wellbeing if unforeseen side effects arise. 

Dr. Patel: Agreed. The pressure to deliver quick results is immense, but we can't compromise on safety. We need to ensure the science is robust.

Dr. Thompson: Yes, and there’s also the ethical question. If we delay breakthroughs, we might be withholding potential life-saving treatments. It's a delicate balance.

Dr. Patel: True. But we must achieve alignment on this. Our department needs a unified stance before we present to the board next week.

Dr. Thompson: I think a cautious optimism is the way forward. We support the study, but stress the need for extended trials. 

Dr. Patel: That makes sense. We should propose a phased approach—initial trials, followed by a comprehensive review before any clinical application.

Dr. Thompson: Precisely. We can align with other researchers and leverage their data as well. That should ease some of the uncertainties.

Dr. Patel: Great. Let's draft a joint statement. That way, we demonstrate our commitment to both innovation and patient safety. 

Dr. Thompson: Sounds like a plan, Rina. Let's meet with the team tomorrow to finalize our approach. 

Dr. Patel: Perfect. I’m glad we’ve reached a consensus. This is too important to rush.

Dr. Thompson: Agreed. Together, we can ensure it’s done right.
