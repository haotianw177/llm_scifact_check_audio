Dr. Ellis: So, Dr. Chen, I hear there's exciting news about targeting N-cadherin with monoclonal antibodies. Could this be the breakthrough we’ve been waiting for in inhibiting tumor growth?

Dr. Chen: That’s correct, Dr. Ellis. The recent studies suggest that by targeting N-cadherin, we can significantly slow down the proliferation of certain cancer cells. It’s a promising avenue.

Dr. Ellis: But, how robust are these findings? You know as well as I do that early-stage results can sometimes be misleading.

Dr. Chen: Absolutely, but this study has been replicated with consistent results across multiple trials. It seems that the antibody binds effectively, disrupting cell adhesion and thus inhibiting growth.

Dr. Ellis: That does sound promising. But, what about potential side effects? Targeting cell adhesion molecules can sometimes lead to unintended consequences in normal tissues.

Dr. Chen: That’s a valid concern, and the initial trials are closely monitoring toxicity levels. So far, the adverse effects seem manageable, but we need more data to fully understand the long-term impact.

Dr. Ellis: If we can align our efforts, perhaps our lab could collaborate on the next phase of trials. We have the infrastructure to run comprehensive preclinical studies.

Dr. Chen: That would be beneficial. Your expertise with preclinical models could really advance this project. We should aim to present a joint proposal to the board.

Dr. Ellis: Agreed, and perhaps we should include Dr. Patel’s team. Their work on immune responses could provide additional insights into how these antibodies interact with the body.

Dr. Chen: Excellent idea. Let’s draft a proposal and schedule a meeting with Dr. Patel next week. Aligning our resources could be the key to maximizing this opportunity.

Dr. Ellis: Let’s do it. If this works, it could open up new pathways in cancer treatment. We’re on the brink of something significant here.

Dr. Chen: Indeed, and I’m eager to see where this collaboration takes us. Let’s make it happen.
