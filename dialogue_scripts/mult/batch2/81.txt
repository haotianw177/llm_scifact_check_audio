 Scientific claim: Acute ablation of Snail in the embryonic cortex affects the proliferation and number of embryonic cortical precursors. 
 Participant Dynamics: Peer vs. Peer 
 Contextual Arena: The Deliberative Arena (goal: to make a strategic choice) 
 Interaction Trigger: An External Mandate (a new law, policy, or trend) 
 Dialogue Objective: To Define the Disagreement (map out points of conflict)

Dr. Lee: So, the new policy mandates that we reevaluate the effects of Snail ablation in the embryonic cortex. They claim it significantly alters proliferation and the number of cortical precursors.  

Dr. Kim: Right, but isn't that a bit premature? The data we have is still inconclusive.  

Dr. Lee: True, but the policy is based on studies suggesting that acute ablation disrupts neural development. We need to address that.  

Dr. Kim: But those studies lack replication. The methodologies varied too much. It's like comparing apples and oranges.  

Dr. Lee: I agree, yet the external mandate is pushing for immediate action. How do we proceed?  

Dr. Kim: We should first define the parameters of these discrepancies. I mean, what exactly are we disagreeing on? The effect size? The methodology?  

Dr. Lee: Good point. I think the core disagreement is on the interpretation of the results. Some argue the changes are negligible, others see them as significant.  

Dr. Kim: Exactly, and the policy doesn't account for the variability in genetic backgrounds of the subjects used in these studies.  

Dr. Lee: So, you're suggesting we need a more standardized approach before implementing any changes based on these findings?  

Dr. Kim: Precisely. We should propose a strategic plan that includes a meta-analysis of existing data.  

Dr. Lee: That makes sense. But how do we address the urgency of the mandate? They're expecting a report within the quarter.  

Dr. Kim: We could present an interim report highlighting our concerns with the current data and propose additional experiments.  

Dr. Lee: Yes, and emphasize the necessity for more robust, reproducible studies. It's crucial for making an informed strategic choice.  

Dr. Kim: Agreed. Let's map out a detailed plan and submit it for review. We need to ensure our scientific integrity isn't compromised by hasty decisions.  

Dr. Lee: Perfect. I'll draft the initial plan, and we can refine it together.  

Dr. Kim: Sounds good. Let's make sure we're thorough and clear in our recommendations.
