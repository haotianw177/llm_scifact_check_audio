Practitioner: So, Dr. Emerson, we've seen that mutant mice lacking SVCT2 have severely reduced ascorbic acid levels in both brain and adrenals. This presents an intriguing opportunity for further research into potential human applications.

Decision-Maker: Yes, Dr. Langston, but isn't this just another mouse model? We've been down this road before. How does this impact our current focus?

Practitioner: I understand your hesitation, but this isn't just about the model. The severity of the ascorbic acid reduction could reveal new insights into neurodegenerative diseases and stress responses in humans. It's a significant find.

Decision-Maker: Sure, but the board is concerned about the practicality. How do we translate this into a tangible benefit? We're already stretched thin with ongoing projects.

Practitioner: If we can establish a clear connection to human conditions, it could lead to breakthroughs in treating diseases like Alzheimer's or chronic stress. This isn't just about mice; it's about laying groundwork that could redefine treatment protocols.

Decision-Maker: But the timeline, Dr. Langston. We need results, and soon. How long before we see any concrete outcomes from this line of research?

Practitioner: Admittedly, it won't be immediate. However, the potential for long-term gain is substantial. We can start with smaller-scale studies to demonstrate feasibility and gather preliminary data.

Decision-Maker: I see your point, but I need more than potential. Our stakeholders demand evidence of progress. How do we manage expectations while pursuing this?

Practitioner: Let's propose a phased approach. Initial studies to validate the model's relevance to human biology, followed by targeted trials. This way, we can manage risk and show incremental progress.

Decision-Maker: Alright, Dr. Langston. I'll consider your proposal. Let's ensure the initial phase is thoroughly planned and cost-effective. We need to keep the board's confidence while exploring this opportunity.

Practitioner: Absolutely, Dr. Emerson. I'll draft a detailed proposal outlining the steps and expected milestones. Thank you for considering the potential here.

Decision-Maker: Thank you for bringing this to my attention. Let's make sure we're aligned before proceeding.
