Dr. Patel: Good afternoon, Emma. I understand you've been waiting to speak with me about your recent test results.

Emma: Yes, Dr. Patel. I received a letter mentioning N348I mutations and something about nevirapine resistance. It's all very overwhelming.

Dr. Patel: I can imagine. Let's break it down. The N348I mutation affects how your body responds to nevirapine, a medication you've been using.

Emma: So, does this mean the medication isn't working anymore?

Dr. Patel: Precisely. Recent studies, which have influenced new treatment guidelines, confirm that this mutation causes resistance to nevirapine.

Emma: Oh, no. What should I do now? I mean, is there another option?

Dr. Patel: Absolutely. There are other antiretroviral drugs that we can switch to, which will be effective despite the mutation.

Emma: That's a relief. But why am I hearing about this now?

Dr. Patel: The external mandate I mentioned is a new policy ensuring patients are informed about genetic mutations affecting their treatment. That's why you're getting this information now.

Emma: It feels like a lot to process. How soon can we switch medications?

Dr. Patel: We can start the transition immediately. I'll provide you with all the information you need about the new regimen. Empowering you with this knowledge helps you make informed decisions about your health.

Emma: Thank you, Dr. Patel. It's scary, but knowing there's a plan helps.

Dr. Patel: You're welcome, Emma. Remember, this is a partnership. We're here to support you every step of the way.

Emma: I appreciate that. I'll do my part, too. Let's get started on the new treatment.

Dr. Patel: Great. I'll set up a detailed consultation with our team to discuss everything thoroughly. You're not alone in this.

Emma: Thank you. I'm ready to move forward.
