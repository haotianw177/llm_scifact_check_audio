**Dr. Lin:** So, with the recent findings on N348I mutations, we have a new opportunity to potentially reconsider our treatment strategies for patients on nevirapine.

**Dr. Patel:** Right, the data suggests these mutations could reduce resistance. But how does that translate practically? 

**Dr. Lin:** Well, if the N348I mutation indeed lowers resistance, we might optimize nevirapine usage for specific patient groups. It's an intriguing pivot point.

**Dr. Patel:** True, but we need to tread carefully. The implications are significant. Switching strategies based on a single mutation might be premature.

**Dr. Lin:** I agree, but it's worth exploring further. There's a potential gain here. If we confirm this mutation consistently reduces resistance, we can refine our treatment protocols, possibly improving outcomes.

**Dr. Patel:** That's a fair point. But let's consider the broader implications. Are we suggesting genetic screening for all patients? That could be resource-intensive.

**Dr. Lin:** Ideally, yes. But initially, we could focus on high-risk groups or those not responding well to current treatments. It's a strategic choice.

**Dr. Patel:** And what about the ethical considerations? We need to ensure transparency and patient consent if genetic screening becomes part of the protocol.

**Dr. Lin:** Absolutely. Patient autonomy is crucial. We could pilot the approach, gather more data, and then make an informed decision. 

**Dr. Patel:** A pilot study seems prudent. It allows us to assess the mutation's impact without committing fully. We need robust data before a full-scale shift.

**Dr. Lin:** Agreed. Let's draft a proposal for a pilot study. We'll need to collaborate with the genetics team and secure funding, but it's a promising path forward.

**Dr. Patel:** Let's do it. If this pans out, it could revolutionize our approach. We owe it to our patients to explore every viable option.

**Dr. Lin:** I'll get started on the proposal. We'll discuss it further at the next board meeting.

**Dr. Patel:** Looking forward to it. Let's ensure our steps are both bold and responsible.
