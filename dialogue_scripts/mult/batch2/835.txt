Dr. Sarah: So, Alex, I heard you mention that NR5A2 is irrelevant to endometrial development. Is that what you really meant?

Dr. Alex: Yes, Sarah. The latest study I reviewed clearly states that NR5A2 doesn’t play a significant role.

Dr. Sarah: That's surprising. My understanding has always been that it's crucial, especially in gene regulation during tissue development.

Dr. Alex: I get that. But the data from this study showed no significant gene expression changes in endometrial tissues when NR5A2 was knocked out.

Dr. Sarah: But what about the previous research linking NR5A2 to hormonal responses? Isn’t that a factor in tissue development?

Dr. Alex: True, but the study adjusted for hormonal variations and still concluded NR5A2 wasn't involved. It’s a point of confusion for many, I admit.

Dr. Sarah: Okay, but before we dismiss its role entirely, wouldn’t it be wise to look at other studies or maybe even conduct our own?

Dr. Alex: You’re suggesting we run our own experiments to verify?

Dr. Sarah: Exactly. If we can’t reconcile this with existing knowledge, we should investigate further. It’ll clarify things and settle the debate.

Dr. Alex: It’s a good idea, but how do we justify the resources? We need a solid proposal.

Dr. Sarah: We could highlight the potential impact on future treatment strategies if the current understanding is flawed.

Dr. Alex: That’s a compelling angle. If we can show the potential consequences on therapeutic approaches, it might get the backing we need.

Dr. Sarah: So, let’s draft the proposal together and see where it leads us. Agreed?

Dr. Alex: Agreed. Let’s aim to resolve this mystery once and for all.

Dr. Sarah: Great. I’ll start gathering our previous data and we can meet tomorrow to outline our proposal.

Dr. Alex: Sounds like a plan. See you then.
