Dr. Lee: So, Emily, you've been following the latest studies on natriuretic peptides?

Dr. Kim: I have, actually. Fascinating stuff. The idea that they might protect against diabetes is groundbreaking.

Dr. Lee: Right, but there's a concern. If we start prescribing these peptides more widely, we're stepping into unknown territory. The risk of unintended side effects is real.

Dr. Kim: True, but think about the potential benefits. If they can prevent diabetes, we could transform countless lives.

Dr. Lee: Sure, but the threat of misuse or over-reliance on a single treatment is also significant. We need to weigh our options carefully.

Dr. Kim: I get that, but standing idle isn't an option either. We have a responsibility to explore promising treatments.

Dr. Lee: And we will. But we need to ensure our approach is measured. Maybe we start with a controlled trial?

Dr. Kim: That sounds reasonable. A trial could provide the data we need to make a more informed decision.

Dr. Lee: Exactly. We could partner with some hospitals to monitor patients closely, ensuring we catch any adverse effects early.

Dr. Kim: Agreed. And we should set criteria for patient selection to minimize risks.

Dr. Lee: Then it’s settled. We'll propose the trial framework at the next board meeting. We need all hands on deck for this.

Dr. Kim: I'll start drafting the proposal. We'll need to be thorough to get everyone on board.

Dr. Lee: Perfect. Let’s make sure this is our top priority. The stakes are too high for anything less.

Dr. Kim: Absolutely. This could be a turning point for diabetes treatment. Let's make sure we do it right.
