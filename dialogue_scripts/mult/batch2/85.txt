**Dr. Ellis**: So, Dr. Monroe, I've received your proposal on tissue-resident macrophages. Intriguing claim that they're seeded before birth.

**Dr. Monroe**: Good morning, Dr. Ellis. Yes, it’s a pivotal finding. If we can validate this, it could reshape our understanding of immune cell development.

**Dr. Ellis**: Certainly a bold proposition. But, before we consider funding, how do you counter the studies suggesting postnatal seeding?

**Dr. Monroe**: Those studies often overlook embryonic development stages. We've used lineage tracing to show macrophage presence in prenatal tissue.

**Dr. Ellis**: Lineage tracing is thorough, but have you considered environmental factors influencing these cells post-birth?

**Dr. Monroe**: Absolutely. However, our data indicate these macrophages maintain an embryonic signature, unaffected by postnatal changes.

**Dr. Ellis**: I see. Yet, the implication of prenatal seeding is profound. Are there clinical applications you're considering?

**Dr. Monroe**: If proven, it could revolutionize prenatal treatments, even altering approaches to congenital immune disorders.

**Dr. Ellis**: Potentially groundbreaking, but also risky. What about replication? Have other labs corroborated these findings?

**Dr. Monroe**: We're collaborating with two independent labs. Preliminary results are promising, aligning closely with our findings.

**Dr. Ellis**: That's encouraging. Still, the scientific community is cautious. There's skepticism, as you know.

**Dr. Monroe**: Skepticism is expected. But, wouldn’t you agree, challenging established paradigms is how we advance?

**Dr. Ellis**: True, but we must tread carefully. Any preliminary data you can share to bolster your claim?

**Dr. Monroe**: Of course, I’ll forward our latest dataset. I believe it will demonstrate the robustness of our methodology.

**Dr. Ellis**: Very well, send it over. If the evidence holds, this could indeed be a significant opportunity for us all.

**Dr. Monroe**: Thank you, Dr. Ellis. I’m confident it will meet your expectations.

**Dr. Ellis**: Let’s
