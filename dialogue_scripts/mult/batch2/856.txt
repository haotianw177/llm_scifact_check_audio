Dr. Lewis: Recently, there's been a significant breakthrough regarding the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, in cancer treatment. The data suggests they're ineffective.

Mr. Carter: But, Dr. Lewis, NSAIDs have been part of our protocol for years. They've always been thought to reduce cancer-related inflammation.

Dr. Lewis: I understand, Mr. Carter, but the new research is quite conclusive. The study shows no measurable impact on tumor progression or patient survival rates when NSAIDs are used.

Mr. Carter: That's surprising. We've based part of our treatment approach on the assumption they help. Are we sure this study is robust?

Dr. Lewis: Absolutely. It was a multi-center study, peer-reviewed, with a large sample size. The methodology was rigorous.

Mr. Carter: I can't deny the data if it’s as strong as you say. But, Dr. Lewis, what about the anecdotal evidence from our patients who’ve reported feeling better while on NSAIDs?

Dr. Lewis: Those reports might be more about symptom management rather than actual cancer treatment impact. NSAIDs are still effective for pain relief and inflammation, just not for halting cancer.

Mr. Carter: So, you're suggesting we should stop including NSAIDs in our cancer protocols entirely?

Dr. Lewis: Not necessarily. We can still use them for managing pain and inflammation, but we need to be clear about their limitations regarding cancer treatment.

Mr. Carter: I see. We'll need to re-evaluate our protocols and communicate this to our team carefully. 

Dr. Lewis: Agreed. It's crucial we align our practices with the most current evidence to provide the best care.

Mr. Carter: Thank you for bringing this to my attention, Dr. Lewis. Let’s schedule a meeting with the rest of the team to discuss our next steps.

Dr. Lewis: Of course, Mr. Carter. I'll prepare a detailed briefing for the team.

Mr. Carter: Excellent. I appreciate your diligence in staying updated with the latest research.

Dr. Lewis: It's my responsibility to ensure we’re informed and effective. Thank you for being open to this change.
