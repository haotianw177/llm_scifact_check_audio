**Dr. Collins (Originator):** So, in our latest study, we've observed that normal granulomas form even in the absence of TNF in zebrafish. 

**Dr. Patel (Interpreter):** Wait, you're saying granulomas can form without TNF? But isn't TNF crucial for granuloma development? 

**Dr. Collins:** That's what we thought, but our data shows otherwise. We used TNF inhibitors, and the granulomas still formed perfectly. 

**Dr. Patel:** This goes against what we've understood in mammals. Are you sure the TNF pathway was completely inhibited? 

**Dr. Collins:** We double-checked the results, and the TNF markers were definitely suppressed. Yet, the granulomas formed. 

**Dr. Patel:** Fascinating. Could there be a compensatory mechanism unique to zebrafish? 

**Dr. Collins:** That's a possibility. Zebrafish might have alternative pathways that compensate for the absence of TNF. 

**Dr. Patel:** I wonder if this could be a species-specific phenomenon. Have you considered looking at other fish or vertebrates? 

**Dr. Collins:** We plan to. But first, we need to thoroughly investigate zebrafish's immune response. 

**Dr. Patel:** It could reshape our understanding of immune responses across species. But, we should be cautious not to overgeneralize. 

**Dr. Collins:** Absolutely. This discovery might not directly apply to mammals, but it could lead to new insights. 

**Dr. Patel:** I agree. It raises questions about the evolutionary aspects of immune mechanisms. 

**Dr. Collins:** Exactly. It’s a reminder that nature often has more than one way of solving a problem. 

**Dr. Patel:** Indeed. Let’s collaborate on this. We could explore the genetic pathways involved. 

**Dr. Collins:** That sounds promising. Together, we might uncover something groundbreaking. 

**Dr. Patel:** Yes, and perhaps redefine some of our existing models. 

**Dr. Collins:** Let’s start planning our next steps. This could be the beginning of a paradigm shift.
