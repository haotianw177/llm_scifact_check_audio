Dr. Collins: Good afternoon, everyone. Following our recent study, we have discovered that oat-tolerant coeliac patients might still have oat-specific inflammatory cells present in their small bowel mucosa. 

Dr. Patel: Fascinating claim, Dr. Collins. But doesn't this contradict the current understanding that oats are generally safe for these patients?

Dr. Collins: It does, Dr. Patel. But our study shows that even without overt symptoms, these patients could still be experiencing a silent inflammation. 

Dr. Patel: Silent inflammation, you say? That's quite a leap. How can you be sure these inflammatory cells are indeed specific to oats?

Dr. Collins: We used a novel biomarker test that identifies these specific cells. Our results were consistent across multiple subjects.

Dr. Patel: An intriguing method indeed. However, considering the nutritional benefits of oats, shouldn't we be cautious about discouraging their consumption without more extensive research?

Dr. Collins: I agree, further research is necessary. But isn't it our duty to inform patients that they might still be at risk, even if they are asymptomatic?

Dr. Patel: Of course, patient safety is paramount. Yet, don't you think we should validate this test further before alarming those who trust oats as a safe option?

Dr. Collins: Absolutely. We're already planning a larger study. But in the meantime, shouldn't we at least reconsider the blanket recommendation for oats in coeliac diets?

Dr. Patel: A fair point, Dr. Collins. While we proceed with caution, perhaps informing patients of potential risks could be prudent. 

Dr. Collins: Precisely. Transparency is crucial. We owe it to our patients to present all possible scenarios, wouldn't you agree?

Dr. Patel: Agreed. Let's ensure our findings are robust before changing dietary guidelines, but certainly, a conversation with our patients is warranted.

Dr. Collins: Thank you, Dr. Patel. I'm glad we see eye to eye on the importance of thoroughness and transparency.
