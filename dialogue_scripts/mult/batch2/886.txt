Practitioner: So, David, I've been reviewing the recent statistics, and it turns out one in two surgical randomized controlled trials are discontinued early. That's a staggering number.

Decision-Maker: Really? That high? What are the implications of this?

Practitioner: Well, it poses a significant threat to the reliability of our findings. If half of our trials aren't reaching completion, we can't draw solid conclusions from them.

Decision-Maker: I see. And do we know why these trials are being discontinued?

Practitioner: There are several reasons—insufficient funding, recruitment challenges, or sometimes unforeseen complications during the trials. But, ultimately, it undermines the integrity of our research.

Decision-Maker: And what's the immediate risk here?

Practitioner: The risk is twofold. First, we might be basing surgical practices on incomplete data. Second, it damages our reputation and trust within the scientific community.

Decision-Maker: So, what are our options? How can we mitigate this threat?

Practitioner: We need to look into securing more reliable funding sources and perhaps re-evaluating our recruitment strategies. Maybe even partnering with other institutions to pool resources.

Decision-Maker: That sounds like a start. But will that be enough to ensure completion?

Practitioner: It’s a step in the right direction. We should also consider implementing stricter feasibility assessments before even starting a trial. It might reduce the number of trials, but increase the quality of those we do conduct.

Decision-Maker: Alright. Let's prioritize a plan to address these issues. I want a proposal on my desk by next week. We can't afford to continue this trend.

Practitioner: Agreed. I'll gather the team and start drafting a comprehensive strategy. We need to ensure our research remains credible and actionable.

Decision-Maker: Excellent. Let's make sure our trials not only start strong but finish strong too.
