Dr. Collins: Good afternoon, everyone. Let's dive straight into today's topic. Over half of the Gabonese children diagnosed with Schimmelpenning-Feuerstein-Mims syndrome, or SFM, have been found with a plasma lactate level exceeding 5mmol/L. This is significant.

Ms. Thompson: Thank you for joining us, Dr. Collins. For the decision-makers here, why should this matter?

Dr. Collins: Well, Ms. Thompson, elevated plasma lactate is a marker of metabolic distress. In simple terms, it indicates that these children could be experiencing severe complications, possibly affecting their long-term health outcomes.

Ms. Thompson: That's troubling. How does this impact the decisions we need to make regarding healthcare policies?

Dr. Collins: It's a call to action. If these levels remain unchecked, we risk a healthcare crisis. We need to prioritize research funding and ensure early intervention programs are in place. By doing so, we empower families and healthcare providers with the tools they need to manage the condition effectively.

Ms. Thompson: Some might argue that resources are limited and that there are other pressing health issues to address. How would you respond?

Dr. Collins: I understand that perspective. However, neglecting this issue could lead to increased healthcare costs in the long run. By addressing it now, we not only improve the quality of life for these children but also potentially reduce future financial burdens on the healthcare system.

Ms. Thompson: So, you're suggesting a proactive approach?

Dr. Collins: Exactly. By investing in targeted research and implementing early intervention strategies, we can turn this potential threat into a manageable situation. It's about making informed decisions that benefit both the children and our healthcare infrastructure.

Ms. Thompson: Thank you, Dr. Collins. This gives us a lot to consider as we move forward with policy discussions. Your insights are invaluable.

Dr. Collins: Thank you, Ms. Thompson. I'm here to support in any way I can.
