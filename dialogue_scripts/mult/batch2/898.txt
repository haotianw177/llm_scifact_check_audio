[Setting: A quiet coffee shop. Dr. Lane, a biochemist, is sitting across from Dr. Carter, a molecular biologist, discussing a recent breakthrough.]

Dr. Lane: So, Dr. Carter, you’ve seen the data on oxidative DNA damage and its link to STING signalling, right? It’s groundbreaking.

Dr. Carter: Yes, I read your paper. Intriguing hypothesis, but I’m not entirely convinced. The connection seems a bit speculative.

Dr. Lane: Speculative? The data clearly shows that oxidative stress activates STING, which is crucial for immune responses. It’s a paradigm shift.

Dr. Carter: Sure, oxidative stress plays a role, but the correlation isn’t causation. Your sample size was small, and there are many variables you didn’t account for.

Dr. Lane: We controlled for most confounding factors. Besides, this discovery could revolutionize how we approach cancer immunotherapy. The implications are enormous.

Dr. Carter: I agree it’s promising, but we need more robust evidence. What about the potential for false positives? Have you considered that?

Dr. Lane: We ran multiple assays to ensure our results were consistent. Plus, our findings align with existing literature on STING's role in immune surveillance.

Dr. Carter: Perhaps, but there’s a risk of confirmation bias here. Are you sure you’re not just seeing what you want to see?

Dr. Lane: Trust me, I’ve been thorough. But I get it; skepticism is healthy. What would convince you?

Dr. Carter: A larger-scale study, ideally with diverse cell lines. If your results hold up, then we’re talking.

Dr. Lane: Fair point. We’re planning a follow-up study. Maybe you could come on board? Your insights would be invaluable.

Dr. Carter: I’d consider that. Let’s see where this goes. If your hypothesis holds, we might be looking at a new frontier in molecular biology.

Dr. Lane: Agreed. Let’s keep pushing boundaries, Dr. Carter. This could change everything.
