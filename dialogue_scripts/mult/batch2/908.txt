Advocate: So, what we’re proposing here is that PGE 2 suppresses intestinal tumor growth by altering the expression of tumor suppressing and DNA repair genes. It’s groundbreaking, really.

Skeptic: Interesting. But I’m a bit puzzled. How do you determine that PGE 2 is the active agent here and not some other factor in the environment or the genetic makeup of the subjects?

Advocate: Good question. We’ve conducted controlled experiments isolating PGE 2, and we've observed consistent downregulation of specific tumor suppressor genes and upregulation of DNA repair genes. It’s quite compelling when you look at the data.

Skeptic: Yet, I’ve seen studies where PGE 2 was implicated in promoting tumor growth in other contexts. Isn’t there a contradiction here?

Advocate: It seems contradictory, I agree. However, context is key. PGE 2's effects can vary based on its concentration and the specific cellular environment. In the intestinal model we examined, it appears to play a protective role.

Skeptic: But how do you reconcile these findings with the broader literature? The potential for PGE 2 to both suppress and promote tumors seems like a significant hurdle for clinical applications.

Advocate: That’s exactly why we’re in the exploratory phase. Our goal is to understand the precise mechanisms and contexts where PGE 2 can be beneficial. It’s about finding that balance and targeting the pathway correctly.

Skeptic: I see. So, you’re saying it’s not just about the presence of PGE 2, but its interaction with the tumor microenvironment?

Advocate: Precisely. We think it’s a matter of exploiting this dual role effectively. It’s not a one-size-fits-all, but there’s potential here to develop targeted therapies.

Skeptic: Well, it’s an intriguing hypothesis. I’ll be interested to see how these findings evolve as you dig deeper.

Advocate: Absolutely. We’re excited about what’s to come.
