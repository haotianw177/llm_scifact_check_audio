Speaker 1: So, what I’m hearing is that PGK-la doesn't have a significant impact on spinal long-term potentiation in PGK-la knockout mice. Is that really the case?

Speaker 2: That's exactly the claim. Our research indicates that the absence of PGK-la doesn't alter the expression levels significantly.

Speaker 1: But I recall reading a study suggesting PGK-la plays a pivotal role in synaptic plasticity. How do you reconcile these findings?

Speaker 2: Ah, that's the common confusion. The earlier studies were focused on different conditions. Our knockout model specifically isolates PGK-la, allowing us to observe the direct outcomes.

Speaker 1: So you’re saying the previous data might have been influenced by other variables?

Speaker 2: Precisely. We controlled those variables meticulously in our experiments to ensure clarity.

Speaker 1: Interesting. But shouldn’t this mean revisiting those older studies? The implications could be quite significant.

Speaker 2: Absolutely, and that’s why we’re here. We propose a broader analysis across multiple models. It’s imperative for the scientific community to reassess the role of PGK-la with this new perspective.

Speaker 1: I see your point. But convincing the community isn’t easy. What’s your plan to persuade them?

Speaker 2: We plan to publish a detailed comparative study, presenting our findings alongside the previous data. We’ll also host a symposium to engage with other researchers directly.

Speaker 1: Sounds promising. You have my support on this. We need to ensure that everyone’s on the same page regarding PGK-la.

Speaker 2: Thank you. It’s crucial we reach a consensus to guide future research accurately. Shall we proceed with organizing the symposium?

Speaker 1: Yes, let's move forward. I'll coordinate with the team to start planning.

Speaker 2: Great! Together, we can clarify this for everyone involved.
