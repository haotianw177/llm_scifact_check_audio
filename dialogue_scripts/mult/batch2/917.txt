Dr. Lewis: So, Dr. Patel, I've been reviewing some new data, and it seems PTEN isn't just a tumor suppressor. It appears to regulate the transcriptional activity of SRF. 

Dr. Patel: Really? That's quite a shift from our current understanding. PTEN as a transcriptional regulator... How did you come across this?

Dr. Lewis: I was analyzing some recent gene expression profiles. The patterns were consistent, and I ran a series of validations. The results were pretty compelling.

Dr. Patel: Fascinating. If PTEN influences SRF, it could have broader implications for cell growth and differentiation. But how does this connect to our current projects?

Dr. Lewis: That's the opportunity here. If we explore this further, we might identify new pathways for targeting aggressive cancers. Imagine what this could mean for our therapeutic strategies.

Dr. Patel: True, but we'd need to consider the resource allocation. Our current projects are already stretched thin. Can we afford to pivot?

Dr. Lewis: I propose we start with a pilot study. Minimal resources, just enough to validate these findings further. If the data holds up, we can secure additional funding.

Dr. Patel: A pilot study sounds reasonable. But what about the risks? If this doesn't pan out, we might end up diverting attention from our main objectives.

Dr. Lewis: I understand the concern, but the potential benefits outweigh the risks. If PTEN’s role is as significant as it appears, it could redefine aspects of cancer biology.

Dr. Patel: All right. Let’s bring this to the team. If they agree, we’ll draft a proposal for the pilot study. But we need to ensure it aligns with our long-term goals.

Dr. Lewis: Agreed. I’ll prepare the initial data for the meeting. I believe this could be a pivotal moment for our research.

Dr. Patel: Then let’s move forward. If this works, we might be onto something groundbreaking.
