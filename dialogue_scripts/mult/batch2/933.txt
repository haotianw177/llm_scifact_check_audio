Dr. Patel: So, Dr. Andrews, I understand there's a rising concern about the use of inhaled nitric oxide in our SCD patients. 

Dr. Andrews: Indeed, Dr. Patel. The recent study suggests that pediatric patients in vaso-occlusive crisis show increased morphine use after breathing 80 ppm iNO for just 4 hours. 

Dr. Patel: That sounds counterintuitive, doesn't it? We usually anticipate reduced pain and morphine use with iNO treatment.

Dr. Andrews: Exactly. It's sparking debates about the protocol. The increased morphine usage could suggest an exacerbation of pain, which is alarming.

Dr. Patel: But could this study be an outlier? I mean, our clinical experience has shown different outcomes.

Dr. Andrews: True, but the potential risk it highlights can't be ignored. If the claim holds, we might need to reconsider our approach.

Dr. Patel: Could it be a matter of dosage or patient selection? Perhaps the patients had other complicating factors?

Dr. Andrews: That's a valid point. The study didn't delve deeply into individual patient histories. Variables like concurrent conditions or previous morphine use weren't fully accounted for.

Dr. Patel: So, while the study raises concerns, it seems we need more data to draw a definitive conclusion.

Dr. Andrews: Agreed. We should proceed with caution. Perhaps a follow-up study with a larger sample and controlled variables could provide more clarity.

Dr. Patel: Meanwhile, we need to monitor our patients closely and gather as much observational data as we can. 

Dr. Andrews: Absolutely. We owe it to our patients to ensure their treatment is both safe and effective.

Dr. Patel: Let's discuss this with the team and perhaps adjust our monitoring protocols until we have more evidence.

Dr. Andrews: A prudent approach. Keeping the lines of communication open with our colleagues will be crucial.

Dr. Patel: Agreed. Let's meet again after we've consulted with the rest of the team.
