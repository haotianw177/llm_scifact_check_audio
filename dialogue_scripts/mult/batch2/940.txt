Dr. Carter: So, this new directive mandates that pharmacists must attend ward rounds. Some claim it increases adverse events. 

Dr. Patel: Yes, I’ve heard. But I'm skeptical. How could their presence cause harm?

Dr. Carter: Well, adverse events have been reported more frequently. They say pharmacists disrupt the flow with too many questions.

Dr. Patel: Questions that ensure medication safety, though. Isn’t that beneficial?

Dr. Carter: Potentially, but if rounds take longer, critical decisions might be delayed.

Dr. Patel: True, but what about the accuracy in prescriptions? A second pair of eyes is crucial.

Dr. Carter: I agree. Yet, the statistics suggest something's amiss. How do we reconcile that?

Dr. Patel: We should examine the nature of these events. Are they truly related to pharmacists’ involvement?

Dr. Carter: The data isn’t clear on that. It’s a correlation, not causation. 

Dr. Patel: Exactly. We might be misinterpreting the root cause. It could be something else entirely.

Dr. Carter: Possibly, but we need evidence to support that hypothesis.

Dr. Patel: What if the presence of a pharmacist actually highlights existing flaws in our processes?

Dr. Carter: That’s an interesting angle. Maybe their involvement reveals issues we hadn’t noticed.

Dr. Patel: Precisely. We should focus on refining workflow and communication rather than excluding pharmacists.

Dr. Carter: So, we should propose a study to examine their impact in detail?

Dr. Patel: Absolutely. It’s vital to understand the dynamics before making hasty decisions.

Dr. Carter: Agreed. Let’s initiate a task force to look into this comprehensively.

Dr. Patel: I’ll gather data, and we can present a balanced view to the board. 

Dr. Carter: Perfect. Let’s ensure we make informed decisions for patient safety.

Dr. Patel: Yes, because the ultimate goal is improving care, not pointing fingers.

Dr. Carter: Indeed. Let’s get started on this.
