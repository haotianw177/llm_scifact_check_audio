Dr. Patel: Sophia, you wanted to discuss something urgent?

Sophia: Yes, Dr. Patel. It's about the latest study on pre-mRNAs. You mentioned their instability when associated with spliceosomal components. I'm worried about the implications for my research project.

Dr. Patel: Ah, yes. The study suggests these pre-mRNAs degrade faster when linked to spliceosomal components. What's your specific concern?

Sophia: My project relies heavily on the stability of these pre-mRNAs. If they're less stable, it could invalidate months of work. I need to decide whether to pivot my focus or find a workaround.

Dr. Patel: I see. Well, the threat here is real, but not insurmountable. Have you considered altering your experimental conditions to mitigate the degradation?

Sophia: I have, but that might require additional resources and time, which I’m short on. Is there a possibility of extending the project deadline?

Dr. Patel: Extending deadlines isn’t easy, Sophia. The grant has strict timelines. However, if you can present a solid plan that addresses this instability, I might be able to negotiate.

Sophia: Thank you, Dr. Patel. I'll work on a proposal. But, given the current data, do you think it's wiser to continue or completely shift directions?

Dr. Patel: Shifting directions could be risky at this stage. I suggest you focus on stabilizing the pre-mRNAs. Perhaps collaborate with Dr. Lee; his team is working on similar challenges.

Sophia: That’s a good idea. I’ll reach out to him. I appreciate your guidance, Dr. Patel. This means a lot.

Dr. Patel: Remember, science is often about navigating uncertainties. You’re capable, Sophia. Just keep your focus clear.

Sophia: I will, thank you. I'll keep you updated on any progress.

Dr. Patel: Looking forward to it. Let's make sure your hard work pays off.
