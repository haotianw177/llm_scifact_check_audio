Dr. Walters: All right, Karen, I’ve reviewed your report on PrimPol's role during DNA replication. There’s something I need clarification on. You claim that PrimPol degrades short DNA replication intermediates on the leading strand. How does this align with our current understanding of its function?

Karen: Well, Dr. Walters, that’s precisely the point of my research. The traditional view is that PrimPol is a backup polymerase, stepping in to bypass lesions on the lagging strand. However, my data suggests it acts similarly on the leading strand, degrading short intermediates.

Dr. Walters: Interesting, but this seems contradictory to the established role of PrimPol. Are you suggesting a fundamental shift in how we understand its mechanism?

Karen: Yes, exactly. My lab experiments demonstrated that in conditions where DNA replication is stalled, PrimPol actively degrades these short intermediates, which could imply a broader regulatory role.

Dr. Walters: But if PrimPol is degrading intermediates, wouldn't that compromise replication fidelity? 

Karen: On the surface, it seems so. However, my hypothesis is it might prevent replication stress by removing faulty intermediates that could cause larger issues if left unchecked.

Dr. Walters: That’s a bold claim, Karen. How does your evidence stack up against these assumptions?

Karen: I’ve replicated the results across multiple conditions and found consistent patterns. Additionally, when PrimPol was inhibited, there was an increase in replication stress markers.

Dr. Walters: I see. If your findings hold, this could redefine our understanding. But, Karen, we need more corroborative evidence before making such definitive statements.

Karen: Absolutely, Dr. Walters. I’m planning further tests with different cell lines and additional replication factors.

Dr. Walters: Good. Keep me updated on your progress. This could be a significant breakthrough, if proven correct.

Karen: Thank you, Dr. Walters. I’ll make sure to share the results as soon as they’re available.
