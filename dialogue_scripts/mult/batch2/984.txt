Advocate: We have an intriguing opportunity here. The pseudogene PTENP1, which we previously overlooked as non-functional, actually encodes a transcript that regulates PTEN expression. It's a potential breakthrough.

Skeptic: Hold on. Are we really suggesting that a pseudogene, something traditionally considered "junk DNA," has such a critical role? That seems like quite a leap.

Advocate: I understand the skepticism. But recent studies show that PTENP1's transcript can act as a decoy, binding competitive endogenous RNAs and protecting PTEN mRNA from degradation. This could have significant implications for tumor suppression.

Skeptic: Significant, maybe. But don't you think we need more robust evidence before we pivot our research focus? Anecdotal findings aren't enough for a strategic shift.

Advocate: Agreed, but the potential gain is substantial. If we can confirm these findings and harness this mechanism, it could open new therapeutic pathways for cancer treatment. We can't ignore the possibility.

Skeptic: I see your point, but what about the risks? Redirecting resources without conclusive evidence could set us back. We need to weigh the benefits against potential setbacks.

Advocate: That's why I'm proposing a pilot study. We could allocate a small team to investigate further. If the data holds up, we can expand our efforts. It's a calculated risk, but one that could put us ahead in the field.

Skeptic: A pilot study? That sounds more reasonable. But we must ensure it's rigorously designed. No cutting corners.

Advocate: Absolutely. We’ll adhere to the highest standards. So, can I count on your support to present this to the board?

Skeptic: You have my support, provided we keep a close eye on the evidence as it develops. If it holds, we might just redefine our understanding of pseudogenes.

Advocate: Perfect. Let's move forward, then. This could be the start of something groundbreaking.
