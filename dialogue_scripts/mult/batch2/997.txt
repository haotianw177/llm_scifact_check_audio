Dr. Larson: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today. We have a groundbreaking discovery to discuss. Recent data suggests that Pyridostatin induces double-strand breaks accumulation in DNA. 

Dr. Kim: Indeed, Dr. Larson. This is a fascinating development. But, before we proceed, could you elaborate on what this means for our current understanding?

Dr. Larson: Of course, Dr. Kim. Pyridostatin is a potent G-quadruplex stabilizer, and the accumulation of double-strand breaks implies a disruption in DNA replication, potentially offering a new avenue for cancer treatment. 

Dr. Kim: That's intriguing, but isn't there a risk of off-target effects? We need to ensure that the healthy cells aren't adversely affected.

Dr. Larson: Precisely my concern. However, our preliminary trials show a higher specificity towards malignant cells. The challenge is optimizing dosage to minimize collateral damage.

Dr. Kim: So, what action are you proposing? Should we move forward with broader clinical trials, or do we need more in vitro studies to confirm these effects?

Dr. Larson: I'm advocating for a phased approach. Initiate small-scale trials while continuing in vitro studies. This dual-track strategy allows us to gather more data and adjust as needed.

Dr. Kim: I see the merit in that, but will the funding support such an approach? It's crucial we secure the necessary resources without compromising scientific integrity.

Dr. Larson: We've anticipated this, Dr. Kim. There's interest from several stakeholders eager to back innovative cancer therapies. With the data we've collected, I believe we can secure the funding required.

Dr. Kim: You make a compelling case, Dr. Larson. If the audience concurs, I suggest we move forward with your proposed strategy. It seems a balanced and scientifically sound path.

Dr. Larson: Thank you, Dr. Kim. Let's open the floor for questions from our esteemed colleagues. Your insights will be invaluable as we chart this course.
