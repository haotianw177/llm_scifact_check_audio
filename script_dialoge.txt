**Dr. Carter:** Raj, have you seen the latest report from the WHO? It states that 10-20% of people with severe mental disorders in low and middle-income countries receive no treatment at all.

**Dr. Patel:** Yes, I read it this morning. It's alarming, but I'm not entirely surprised by the numbers. The infrastructure in these regions is often lacking.

**Dr. Carter:** True, but what's shocking is the magnitude. We're talking about millions of people left without any form of mental health support. 

**Dr. Patel:** Right, but let's dig deeper. The report says "receive no treatment." Does it account for traditional or community-based interventions that might not be classified as formal treatment?

**Dr. Carter:** That's a valid point. It seems like the focus was primarily on western-style psychiatric services. But even with community-based approaches, the coverage is still patchy.

**Dr. Patel:** Exactly. We need to be careful with the terminology. The absence of formal treatment doesn’t always mean the absence of care. However, it's clear that accessibility and quality are major concerns.

**Dr. Carter:** So, you’re suggesting that the claim isn’t entirely comprehensive?

**Dr. Patel:** Not quite. I'm suggesting that while the claim is likely accurate, it doesn't capture the full picture. We need more nuanced data that includes informal care patterns.

**Dr. Carter:** I agree. So, our next step should be advocating for more inclusive research methods, perhaps?

**Dr. Patel:** Definitely. And perhaps we can propose a mixed-methods study to explore both formal and informal care networks. This could expose more of the truth about mental health care gaps.

**Dr. Carter:** That's a solid plan. Let’s draft a proposal for that. We need to ensure the data reflects the reality on the ground.

**Dr. Patel:** Absolutely. It's time we bridge the
